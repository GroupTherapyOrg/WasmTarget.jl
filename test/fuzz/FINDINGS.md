# Fuzzer findings — cross-cutting notes

Per-gap root-cause analysis now lives **inside each gap file** under its
`## Analysis` heading (`test/fuzz/failures/<id>.md`) — that section is **preserved
across fuzzer re-records** by `Ledger.record_gap!`, so a fix loop's notes are never
clobbered. See `failures/INDEX.md` for the live list. This file holds only
observations that don't map onto a single auto-generated gap.

## ⚠ Union{Int,Float}-return representation is lossy + has a validation gap (2026-06-28)

`f(x) = x>0 ? 1 : 2.5` (return `Union{Float64,Int64}`) fails wasm validation ("expected f64,
found i64") AND, more deeply, WT represents `Union{Float64,Int64}` as **f64** — which cannot
distinguish Int `1` from Float `1.0` at runtime (lossy). The immediate symptom: the i64 arm of
the merge isn't `f64.convert`ed to the f64 union rep (generate_nested_conditionals / the phi
result type for a numeric Union isn't driving the conversion). The deeper issue is the
representation itself. **dart2wasm boxes union/dynamic values** (a common ref with a class-id
tag) rather than collapsing to a single numeric — that is the principled fix (box numeric Union
arms to a tagged ref), but it is a substantial change to WT's union model, NOT a quick coercion
patch. Repro: `p_unionvec`/`p_anyret` in `test/fuzz/cleanup_probe_corpus.jl` (the 2 standing
probe ERRs). Out of scope for the byte-identical cleanup; flagged for the union-model work.

## ✅ SOUNDNESS FIXED (2026-06-28, cleanup loop): multivar if/else phi-merge drops all-but-one

A diamond merge (an `if/else` whose branches assign **≥2 variables still live after the merge**)
WAS lowered as a value-producing `if (result T)` block that carried only ONE value out — so only
one phi local was stored; the rest silently read back as 0. `g1(7)`=8 not 7008; `g3` kept only
the last of 3; `sort2`/`twoUse` dropped one. SINGLE-live-var branches and the ternary form were
fine, which is why the suite stayed green. Confirmed native-vs-Node + WAT.
**ROOT FIX (Dale's root-cause mandate):** route ANY merge with ≥2 phi nodes to
`generate_stackified_flow`, which stores every live phi local at the edge via
`set_phi_locals_for_edge!` — instead of the value-block generators (`generate_nested_conditionals`
/ `generate_if_then_else`) that could carry only one. Closed BOTH dispatch paths:
`generate_complex_flow` (stackified.jl, `n_phi_nodes >= 2`) + `is_simple_conditional` (flow.jl).
Full `Pkg.test()` + differential fuzzer GREEN. Regression guard (now passing, CI-wired):
`test/fuzz/repro_multivar_phi_merge.jl`. NOT related to `fix_consecutive_local_sets` (which stays
genuinely dead — the dropped store was never emitted).

## ✅ SOUNDNESS FIXED (2026-06-29, parity loop): heterogeneous-Union value extraction (F31) + i31 int-box truncation (F-i31)

`a = x>0 ? 42 : "neg"; Int(a)` (heterogeneous `Union{Int64,String}`) compiled, but reading the
value TRAPPED on a null deref — the live arm flowing into the tagged-union phi-local was dummied
to `ref.null` (`emit_phi_type_default` / `set_phi_locals_for_edge!` line-1100 fallback +
`compile_phi_value`'s literal/SSA/recompute mismatch fallbacks). The `isa` tag survived only via
branch-folding (it never read the value), which masked the gap. **ROOT FIX:** the phi-store now
CONSTRUCTS the tagged-union struct (`emit_wrap_union_value`) when a concrete variant (`vt <: uT`)
flows into a registered tagged-union phi-local — `phi_tagged_union_wrap` in `src/codegen/unions.jl`
gates it; wired into all phi-store dispatches (compile_phi_value ×4 incl. the literal + Core.Argument
edge, set_phi_locals_for_edge! routing). `p_anyret` (a standing probe ERR) now compiles AND is
value-faithful → probe ERRs = 0.

**F-i31 (deeper, a SILENT MISCOMPILE that shipped in v0.4.0):** the tagged-union value field
boxed ints via `ref.i31` (31-bit) → any int ≥ 2^30 was SILENTLY TRUNCATED (verified
`typemax(Int64)` → -1, `2^31` → 0, `3e9` → 852516352). Floats were already boxed full-width into
the `{typeId,value}` numeric box; ints were not. **ROOT FIX:** box ALL numerics full-width into
the numeric box in `emit_wrap_union_value` + read them back symmetrically in
`emit_unwrap_union_value` (the i31-vs-struct split named in PARITY_LEDGER F31). Loop B's numeric
`Union{Int,Float}` AnyRef path was already full-width (unaffected). Verified faithful across the
full Int64 range native-vs-wasm. Migration corpus BYTE-IDENTICAL (no corpus fn used tagged-union
ints). Regression guard: `test/f31_union_value_backfills.jl` (CI-wired, shard 0). **Flag for Dale:
worth a v0.4.1 patch once merged — large-int tagged/heterogeneous unions silently truncated in
0.4.0.**

## ⚠ Float16 is mis-represented end-to-end (F26) — DEFERRED feature (2026-06-29, parity probe)

A broad differential probe (26 cases across uint wraparound, bit-rotate, div/rem/fld/cld/mod,
gcd/lcm, NaN/Inf, ldexp, modf, hypot, cbrt, expm1, Char) found the surface largely sound — the
ONE gap was Float16 arithmetic. Characterization:
  * `add_float`/`sub_float`/`mul_float`/`div_float` pick `arg_type===Float32 ? F32_* : F64_*`, so
    a Float16 operand (represented as its i32 bit-pattern) gets an `f64.*` op on an i32 → INVALID
    wasm (caught loudly at validation — not a silent miscompile).
  * Worse, `fptrunc` (calls.jl ~5660) hard-assumes "source Float64 → target Float32" and emits a
    bare `f32.demote_f64`; it does NOT encode to Float16 bits. So `Float16(x)` mis-produces an f32,
    inconsistent with `_compile_call_fpext`'s Float16→Float64 path (which correctly decodes i32
    half-float bits). Float16 is mis-typed coming AND going.
Proper fix = a Float16 representation overhaul: pick ONE rep (i16/i32 bits), implement faithful
f16↔f32 conversions (fptrunc target-f16 encode w/ round-to-nearest-even incl. subnormal/inf/nan;
fpext source-f16 — exists), and route arithmetic through promote→f32-op→demote (Julia computes
Float16 ops via Float32, so f32 — not f64 — intermediate is needed for bit-faithful division).
DEFERRED as a focused feature sub-loop (rounding-sensitive; risky to patch piecemeal). Not a
silent-soundness hole today (invalid wasm fails at validation). **Flag for Dale.**

## 🔴 TOP PRIORITY — SILENT MISCOMPILE: filtered generator → reducer returns 0 (2026-06-29 probe)

`sum(i for i in 1:n if iseven(i))` returns **0** instead of 120 (n=8) — a SILENT WRONG VALUE in a
very common pattern. Confirmed across `sum`/`maximum` and both named (`iseven`) and anonymous
(`i->i>5`) predicates (gen_filter_body/sq/gt/max all → 0). NOT invalid wasm, NOT a trap — it
compiles to valid wasm that silently returns the empty/init value.

Characterization (tight):
  * `sum(i^2 for i in 1:n)` (UNfiltered generator) — WORKS (→30). So `_foldl_impl(BottomRF{add_sum},
    _InitialValue(), range)` + the `Union{_InitialValue,Int}` accumulator is fine on its own.
  * `sum([i^2 for i in 1:n if iseven(i)])` (materialized ARRAY comprehension) — WORKS (→120).
  * Only the LAZY filtered generator consumed directly by a reducer fails. It lowers to
    `Base._foldl_impl(Base.FilteringRF{pred, BottomRF{add_sum}}, Base._InitialValue(), 1:n)`
    (verified via code_typed). The ONLY delta vs the working unfiltered case is the `FilteringRF`
    wrapper: `(op)(acc,x) = op.flt(x) ? op.rf(acc,x) : acc`.
BLAST RADIUS (2nd probe): the same silent-0 hits `mapreduce(f, +, Iterators.filter(...))`,
`prod(i for i in 1:n if cond)`, AND `sum(Iterators.flatten(...))` — but NOT `sum(Iterators.takewhile(...))`,
`sum(Iterators.map(...))`, nested generators `sum(i+j for i in 1:2 for j in 1:n)`, `count(pred, r)`,
or `sum(collect(Iterators.filter(...)))`. The PASS/FAIL split is decisive: a fold whose steps can
**skip updating the accumulator** (filter skips non-matches; flatten's inner range can be empty)
FAILS; folds that update on every step (takewhile/imap/nested) PASS.

Refined root cause: NOT the predicate call — `FnHolder(iseven)`/`FnHolder(closure)` field-calls
both compile + run correctly (hypothesis refuted). It's the `acc::Union{_InitialValue, T}`
accumulator PHI when a fold step leaves `acc` unchanged (still `_InitialValue`): the union-acc phi
across skip-steps collapses (acc stuck at `_InitialValue` → reducer → 0). Unfiltered folds work
because the `_InitialValue→T` transition happens exactly once on step 1, never persisting across
steps. ADJACENT to the F31 phi-store work (2c2c704) but in the fold-LOOP acc phi. Reduce/fold
HOT-PATH — a wrong fix silently miscompiles ALL reductions → focused full-suite+diff-fuzz-gated fix,
NOT a blind patch (the F3 hot-path attempt already regressed the lattice tests). **Flag for Dale:
#1 correctness priority.** Diff-fuzzer should grow a `reduce/sum/prod/mapreduce(... if ...)` +
`flatten` family so this class can't regress silently.

## ✅ FIXED (2026-06-29 probe): sort(v, by=f) / sort(v, lt=cmp) silently dropped the comparator

Another SILENT MISCOMPILE (common pattern): `sort(v, by=f)` returned the default-`isless` order
(e.g. `sort([3,1,5,2], by=x->-x)[1]` → 1 instead of 5; `lt=` likewise). `rev=true` worked. Root:
the non-mutating `Base.sort` overlay (`src/codegen/interpreter.jl`) did `sort!(result, rev=rev)` —
forwarding ONLY `rev`, silently dropping `by`/`lt`/`order`. The `sort!` overlay body already honors
lt/by/rev correctly; the bug was purely the forwarding. Fixed to forward all comparator kwargs.
Backfill `test/sort_comparator_backfills.jl` (CI-wired shard 0). `sortperm` was ALSO wrong (no
overlay → generic Base.sortperm mis-compiled to the IDENTITY permutation, silent-wrong) — FIXED
with a sortperm overlay (stable insertion sort on the index vector comparing by v[idx], honors
by/lt/rev), same backfill file.

## ⛔ F3 (Core.Box mutable capture) — ATTEMPTED ×2, REVERTED both times (2026-06-29)

Closures that MUTATE a captured var still emit invalid wasm — DEFERRED. A delegated agent's
scalarization-rebox approach (rebox numeric→Any in `compile_statement`) passed its narrow backfill
AND the full suite, but independent adversarial re-verification exposed it as fundamentally
incomplete: two-closures-sharing-a-box → trap, conditional mutation `iseven(i)&&(c+=i)` → silently 0
(new silent-wrong), read-after-mutate → trap, escaping closure → loud-reject, and returning a mutated
capture without a `::T` annotation returns a boxed anyref (no return-unbox). It only handles trivial
accumulator loops. Proper F3 = heap-`Core.Box`-as-struct + cross-closure box SHARING + conditional
phi + return-unbox + escaping capture — a real feature, not a `compile_statement` rebox hack.

## Parity probe sweep (2026-06-29) — surface is largely SOUND; remaining gaps triaged

Two broad differential sweeps (~52 cases) across uint wraparound/overflow, bit-rotate,
leading/trailing-zeros, div/rem/fld/cld/mod, gcd/lcm, Float NaN/Inf, f32 round, ldexp, modf,
hypot, cbrt, expm1, Char, complex, rational, ranges, arrays (sum/sort/find/filter/map/reverse/
comprehension/matmul), tuples, namedtuples, dict, set, and string ops — **all pass** except the
documented deferred gaps. Net: WT's core+stdlib codegen is in strong shape; remaining gaps are
niche features or stdlib-overlay candidates, none a silent miscompile.

Triaged remaining gaps:
  * Int128/UInt128 div/rem + bswap — loud-reject (F11b, fixed this session). Full impl deferred.
  * Float16 arithmetic + fptrunc-to-f16 — invalid-wasm-at-validation; deferred feature (F26, above).
  * `string(::String, ::Int)` and `repr(::Int)` — sound `unreachable` trap. `string(::Int)`,
    `"$x"` interpolation, `string(::Float64)`, `string(::String,::String)` all WORK; only the
    generic multi-arg-MIXED `print_to_string`/IOBuffer path traps. This is a **stdlib-overlay
    candidate** (overlay `string`/`print` for mixed args, per [[wt-genericlinearalgebra-overlay-lever]]
    pattern) → Dale's lane (#4 stdlib expansion), not the codegen-soundness lane.

## Remaining 16 gaps (the deep/feature long tail) — all root-caused & triaged for Part 2

Every tractable gap is fixed (see "Fixed" below). The 16 that remain each need real
codegen/feature work, not an overlay — full root-cause is in each gap file's
`## Analysis`. They collapse onto **six shared roots**, so the fix count is far smaller
than the gap count:

1. **Unicode `Char` tables (feature)** — `uppercase('é')` (`ff2542499cc2`),
   `isspace('é')` (`bc93362af34e`), `isdigit(uppercase('é'))` (`6bd3c602cf17`). Char
   case/category for codepoints ≥ 0x80 needs Unicode tables; ASCII works.
2. **Float→string / Ryu** — `string(::Float64)` (`19d59e9a61b3`) — NOW WORKS
   (2026-06-13 campaign re-check: `string(0.0/1.5/12345.678/-0.5/0.1)` all bit-exact
   vs native, standalone AND with bridge accessors in-module). The old "writeshortest
   unbalanced control frames in module-context" defect is gone. `19d59e9a61b3` itself is
   marked fixed; leaving this list entry only as a historical pointer.
3. **map-kernel-dependency codegen** — a *compiled* function mis-executes when pulled
   in as a `map` kernel: `length(::String)` (`3b005c4957f7`), `atan`/`asin` with a
   constant arg (`5511171c8055`), and `Dict`-in-kernel (`a771b83dda7c`, `f3829eae0fbb`).
4. **SubString / `String(bytes)` codegen** — `codeunit(::SubString)` reads return 0 in
   nested builds, and freshly-built strings misbehave: strip unicode (`0beb5ec969a2`),
   `uppercase(::SubString)` (`05bc422e7ffb`). The reverted `length(::String)` overlay
   also lives here (see [3]).
5. **`Dict` construction edges** — duplicate-key Dict literals return garbage
   (`dbac068444b5`), and combine with SubString values (`627592b54cf2`) / strip
   defaults (`787f51057ef8`).
6. **scratch-local aliasing across operand boundaries** — `unique∘cumsum` then `lcm`
   (`a48cf6e47497`), `push!∘pushfirst!` + `Set` (`905344436a9f`); same class as the
   now-fixed `maximum(sort(...))` cluster. Fix = local reuse across operands.

Plus one isolated **constant-folding-parity** case: `0x01 << <Int64-typemin literal>`
(`31d4d64b9325`) — native folds it to `0.0`; WasmTarget evaluates the shift. The common
runtime narrow-shift bug it resembles is **fixed** (see below).

## Fixed (verified-closed via the loop)

- **`i32.const` length operand for string/Symbol/array literals was UNSIGNED-LEB
  encoded (Pluto campaign, 2026-06-15)** — `compile_value` for `String`/`Symbol`
  (codegen/values.jl) and the large-array path (codegen/dispatch.jl) emitted the
  `array.new_data`/`array.new` LENGTH via `encode_leb128_unsigned`, but `i32.const`
  operands are **signed LEB128** (`s33`). A literal whose length lands in the band
  where unsigned-LEB ≠ signed-LEB — most commonly **[64,127]** (1-byte unsigned-LEB
  with bit-6 set: e.g. 90 → `0x5A`, signed-decodes to **−38**) — produced a NEGATIVE
  length → `array.new_data` with a huge unsigned count → `"requested new array is too
  large"` trap at RUNTIME. **Validation passed**, so it was invisible until executed;
  short literals (<64) coincidentally encoded identically, hiding it for a long time.
  Surfaced by Snapshot.jl interactive-feedback cells (admonition HTML segments are
  ~89/102/217/230 bytes). Fix: `encode_leb128_signed(Int32(len))` at all three sites.
  Regression: `test/runtests.jl` "String literal length — i32.const signed-LEB"
  (runs in node; asserts wasm == native for a 90-char literal). NOTE: `array.new_fixed`
  *immediate* counts and type/segment/local indices are genuinely u32 — left unsigned.

- **structref-vs-concrete-ref type precision on `<: Number` structs (Pluto campaign,
  2026-06-13)** — `Complex`, `Rational`, `RGB{N0f8}`/`N0f8` are `<: Number`, so
  `is_struct_type` returns false and `get_concrete_wasm_type` types them as the abstract
  `structref` wherever they appear as a function PARAM or bridge-ctor arg — while the
  struct registry / field types use the concrete `(ref null $T)`. Two emission sites then
  mismatched: (a) `struct.get $T` against a `structref` param (Base `show(::Complex)`
  reads `z.re`/`z.im` — `func $show` param declared `structref`); (b) `struct.new $Outer`
  with a `structref` field value (PI Bridge ctors `_mk_…RGB…N0f8`, fractals Complex
  labels). Fixed with abstract→concrete `ref.cast null $T`: extended
  `emit_ref_cast_if_structref!` (context.jl) to the `Core.Argument`/param case, and added
  the matching ConcreteRef branch on the struct.new field path (statements.jl). The cast
  is a no-op when the value is already `$T` and traps otherwise (sound). Verified:
  `Bridge._make_ctor(RGB{N0f8})` + Base-only `Complex{Rational{Int64}}` ctor & field read
  now validate; closes the **RGB{N0f8} struct.new** gap (FINDINGS Class 2) and the
  type-precision half of **`cfd419793b0d`** (Complex display — its remaining show-machinery
  dead-value bug stays open). Guarded by `@testset "Numeric-struct field struct.new/
  struct.get (WASMTARGET-FUZZ)"`. Also removed a stray `DEBUG_STRUCT_NEW_2EXTERN` stdout
  `println` left in `compile_new`.
- **heterogeneous-tuple runtime indexing + union-representation consistency (Pluto
  campaign, 2026-06-15)** — three coupled fixes that turn `Any[a, "x", a]` and
  `md"…$x…$y…"` interpolation from a hard `unreachable`/null-deref into working code
  (Basic-mathematics `:n` cell). (1) **Abstract `::Vector` struct FIELD** (e.g.
  `Markdown.Admonition.content::Vector`, a UnionAll) mapped to a raw array, but every
  Julia `Vector{T}` *value* is a vector-STRUCT (register_vector_type!) with no shared
  supertype — `struct.new` mismatched (`expected (ref $rawarray), found (ref
  $Vector{T}-struct)`). Now → `AnyRef` (structs.jl, `_register_struct_type_impl!`).
  (2) **Heterogeneous tuple + dynamic index**: `getfield(::Tuple{A,B,…}, i::Int)`
  (only homogeneous tuples were supported) now emits a runtime if-chain on `i` that
  reads field `i` and wraps it into `Union{fieldtypes…}` via `emit_wrap_union_value`,
  so the existing `isa`/π consumers work (calls.jl). `Base.getindex(Any, vals...)`
  loops exactly this. (3) **`get_concrete_wasm_type` ↔ `julia_to_wasm_type_concrete`
  union agreement**: the former returned `AnyRef` for a heterogeneous union while the
  latter (the SSA-local allocator) used the tagged-union STRUCT — so the final SSA
  store saw a false type mismatch, DROPped the value and substituted `ref.null` →
  null deref. `get_concrete_wasm_type`'s multi-variant-union branch now mirrors the
  local allocator (types.jl). Guarded by `@testset "Heterogeneous tuple runtime-index
  → tagged union"` + `@testset "Abstract ::Vector struct field"`. **Still open** above
  this: `string(::Markdown.MD)` / `Markdown.plain` recurse `plain(io, content[i])`
  over heterogeneous AST nodes (Paragraph/Bold/Admonition/…) — WT compiles the
  recursive call as a single static call with `ref.cast (ref null $MD)`, so it traps
  ("illegal cast") on a Paragraph. Full markdown rendering needs runtime dynamic
  dispatch over the AST node types (open-world) — a separate, larger gap; and a
  CONSTANT heterogeneous tuple with a runtime index still traps (the `obj_arg` is a
  `Core.Const`, a different compile path than the param-built tuple).
- **`sinh`/`cosh`/`tanh`(Float64) hyperbolic** — were value-stubs (no native
  codegen): `sinh(x)` emitted nothing on the stack, so `hypot(Inf, sinh(x))`
  failed wasm validation ("expected f64 but nothing on stack"). Implemented via
  the working `exp`: `cosh = (eᵃ+e⁻ᵃ)/2` (exact); `sinh` uses a Taylor branch for
  |x|<0.35 (the `eˣ-e⁻ˣ` form loses precision to cancellation near 0); both use an
  overflow-safe `eᵃ/2 = exp(a-ln2)` for |x|>20 (matches native finite `sinh(710)`
  where the naive form overflows to Inf); `tanh = sinh/cosh` with |x|>20 ⇒ ±1.
  Verified 42/42 vs native across the sample range incl. ±0/±Inf/NaN and the
  danger band [1e-12,1e-7]. Float32 redirects through Float64. Closed
  `0ef240ffe2b5`; guarded by `@testset "Hyperbolic sinh/cosh/tanh"`. (The
  generator's `expm1`/`log1p`/`sinpi`/… are the same value-stub class — next batch.)
- **`reduce`/`foldl`(Vector) with `min`/`max`** — `reduce(op, v)`/`foldl(op, v)`
  lowered through native `mapreduce`/`mapfoldl`, whose CFG keeps a `mapreduce_impl`
  block (the >1024-element branch) that emits invalid wasm. The module failed to
  validate **even for tiny vectors that never reach that branch**, so every
  reduce/foldl trapped (lax mode returned the MAX for a `min` reduction —
  `reduce(min,[5,3,8,1])` → 8). Fixed with `Base.reduce(op::F,::Vector)` /
  `Base.foldl` left-fold overlays (exact for the generated +/*/min/max). `op::F`
  forces specialization so the empty-collection identity folds to a constant
  (avoids a `dynamic invoke reduce_empty(…)::Union{}` that won't compile). Closed
  `742d636e6708`, `f1ba8bacdda5`; guarded by `@testset "reduce/foldl(min/max)"`.
- **`rem`/`mod`(Float64) precision** — `x - trunc(x/y)*y` rounds for large quotients;
  replaced with Sterbenz-exact scaled subtraction (bit-exact vs native fmod).
- **Float32 `exp`/`exp2`/`exp10`** — Float32 kernel emitted invalid wasm; redirect
  through the correct Float64 kernel (≤1 ULP).
- **Narrow-width integer `<<` (UInt8/UInt16)** — `0x01 << x` (a UInt8 shift) ran in an
  i32 register without truncating to the operand's width, so e.g. `0x01 << 8` gave 256
  instead of 0. Fixed in `_emit_shift_guarded!`/`_julia_int_width` (calls.jl): the
  over-shift threshold now uses the Julia type width and the `shl` result is masked to
  that width; the i64→i32 shift-amount wrap now saturates so a huge amount can't wrap
  to a no-op. Closed `39f963bc044a`. (The folded literal-typemin case `31d4d64b9325`
  is a separate constant-folding-parity edge — see above.)
- **`isless`(Float32) / `sort`(Vector{Float32})** — Base's Float32 `isless` emitted
  invalid wasm (`type mismatch: expected i64, found anyref`), so *any* Float32
  ordering failed to compile. Surfaced by the bounded CI fuzz (seed 0xCD) as
  `length(sort([0f0,0f0,0f0]))`; fixed with an `isless(::Float32,::Float32)` overlay
  mirroring the Float64 one. Regression-guarded by `@testset "sort/isless(Float32)"`
  in `runtests.jl` and by the CI fuzz seed itself.
- **`asin`(Float64)** — Base's 600-stmt asin traps as a *map-kernel dependency*;
  overlaid as `atan(x/√((1-x)(1+x)))` (atan works in map), ≤1 ULP.
- **`startswith`/`endswith`** — were String-only; generalized to `AbstractString` so
  SubString operands (e.g. `chomp(t)`) byte-compare in place (`String(::SubString)`
  would memmove-trap).
- **`unique`(Vector{Float})** — `==` deduped -0.0/0.0; Float-specialized overlays add a
  signbit check (isequal semantics) without breaking the String-safe generic path.
- **`maximum`/`minimum`(Vector)** — explicit signed loop + NaN poison; also dissolved
  the `maximum(sort(...))` scratch-aliasing composition cluster.
- **Dict construction/length** — ref/i64 confusion (closed 18 gap variants).
- **Integer shift `<<`/`>>` over-shift** — wasm masks the shift amount to `mod bitwidth`;
  Julia yields 0 (shl/lshr) or sign-fill (ashr) for shift ≥ bitwidth. Fixed with a
  width-aware guard (`_emit_shift_guarded!`, calls.jl). Closed 4 gaps.
- **`reverse(String)` unicode** — reversed bytes, splitting multi-byte codepoints.
  Now reverses by character. Closed 1 gap.
- Plus: `hypot`, `string(Int64)` (typemin), `first`/`last` bounds, `argmax`/`argmin`
  NaN+signed-zero, and the soundness apparatus (strict mode, value-stub refusal).

- **Integer shift `<<`/`>>` over-shift** — wasm masks the shift amount to `mod bitwidth`;
  Julia yields 0 (shl/lshr) or sign-fill (ashr) for shift ≥ bitwidth. Fixed with a
  width-aware guard (`_emit_shift_guarded!`, calls.jl). Closed 4 gaps.
- **`reverse(String)` unicode** — reversed bytes, splitting multi-byte codepoints.
  Now reverses by character. Closed 1 gap.

## Known deep gaps (entangled with underlying codegen bugs)

- **`strip`/`lstrip`/`rstrip` unicode** — overlays use `length(s)` (char count) to
  byte-index `codeunit` (drops trailing bytes of multibyte UTF-8). Switching to
  `ncodeunits` exposes TWO deeper codegen bugs the originals contort around:
  (1) **`ncodeunits` on a `String(bytes)` result** returns wrong values (aliasing),
  and (2) a **complex boolean condition + `break` in a `while`** loop miscompiles
  (whitespace-find loop stops trimming). A correct single-pass strip trips (2).
  Real fix needs those two codegen bugs fixed first — then strip becomes trivial.
- **Dict ops** — emit malformed wasm: `type mismatch: expected i64, found (ref $type)`
  — a ref/i64 confusion in Dict construction/length codegen (18 gap variants).

## Known deep gaps (need C-lib-call → WasmGC work)

- **`collect(Vector)` / memmove** — `collect([a,b,c])` lowers to a raw-pointer
  `memmove` foreigncall that doesn't map to WasmGC arrays → traps. Omitted from the
  generator (contrived for vectors); real `collect` coverage needs ranges/generators
  (Part 2) and a WasmGC `array.copy`-based memmove.

## Observations not yet captured as gaps

- **`Vector == Vector` traps.** `sort([0,x,x]) == sort([0,x,x])` traps in wasm where
  native returns `true`. Surfaced by a manual probe, not the fuzzer, because the
  generator has no `Vector{T} == Vector{T} → Bool` op yet. Add that op to
  `generators.jl` (`OPS`) and the loop will auto-discover + document it.

## Coverage gaps worth adding to the generator (the ongoing crank)

- `Vector == Vector`, `in`, `findfirst`, `searchsorted`
- `Dict`/`Set` construction + lookup (needs key/value sub-generators)
- `Int32`/`UInt*` numeric universes; `round/trunc(Int, ::Float64)` (trap-prone — good oracle targets)
- ranges with bounded literal sizes (`1:k`, `k:step:m`)
- string conversions once `int_to_string`/`float_to_string` are fixed (see those gaps)

## P4-stdlib: 1.13 wrapper-shape generator limitation (open, overlay-mitigated)

`Statistics.median(v::Vector{Float64})` on Julia 1.13: the WRAPPER
specialization inlines `copyto!`-machinery whose IR has a catchable
boundscheck throw arm (`invoke throw_boundserror; unreachable`)
immediately before an intra-range jump target, inside a function that
routes to the stackifier (conditionals > 2). The compiled module
validates but the runtime path dead-codes a later GotoIfNot condition
to `i32.const 0; unreachable` (V8 trap at the condition). The literal
definition `median!(copy(v))` — semantically identical — compiles
correctly; `WasmTargetStatisticsExt` reroutes the wrappers via
1.13-gated overlays.

Status: mitigated, root cause NOT fixed. The conditionals-path range
walk got a resume-at-jump-target fix (compile_range, P4-stdlib), but
this shape compiles via the stackifier whose per-block resets did not
prevent it — the dead-coding site is still unidentified (the flag
leaks somewhere between block statement compilation and terminator
condition emission). Forensics: WT_TRACE_DEADVAL=1 shows ~121
dead-value emissions; WT_TRACE_STUBARGS / WT_TRAP_STACK exist. A
depth-5+ fuzz sweep over boundscheck-arm + jump-target compositions is
the likely organic reproducer source; until then this note is the
tracking entry.

## Snapshot.jl featured-corpus → WT work-list (2026-06-13)

Source: the 30 non-shipping bond groups of the Snapshot.jl featured corpus
(35/65 ship after the PI bind fixes). Triage of every WT-side degradation
reason in `Snapshot.jl/tools/ISLAND_SURVEY.md`. The blockers split into four
classes — **only Classes 1–2 are conventional codegen/fuzzer work**; Class 3 is
the larger bucket and is *not* fuzzer-tractable.

### Class 1 — genuine WT codegen bugs
- **Canvas-render: a MULTI-BUG CHAIN (2026-06-14 campaign).** The figure-render
  path (WasmMakie `render!` compiled via `compile_module` + canvas2d imports —
  turtles ×4, conv1d, conv2d ×4, newton figures, Titration) is gated by a CHAIN
  of codegen bugs, fixed one at a time via WasmMakie's `compile_with_canvas`
  harness + a focused W-002 differential (host RecordingCtx stream vs wasm
  command stream in node):
  1. **Int128/UInt128 struct FIELD registration — FIXED.** `_register_struct_type_impl!`
     lacked the `Int128|UInt128 → int128 struct ref` branch that `register_tuple_type!`
     has, so a render struct with a 128-bit field errored "Primitive type too large
     for Wasm field: Int128 (16 bytes)". Added the branch (structs.jl). NOTE this
     is a PRE-EXISTING main regression — `git`-confirmed the identical failure at
     main 1531b26, and the old "i64/f64 mismatch" symptom is gone/superseded; the
     baseline 38/65 survey was on an OLDER WT where canvas still compiled.
     Int128 *arithmetic on a field value* is a SEPARATE op gap (Int128 `÷`/`%`
     trap/mis-validate) — not needed for canvas, which only stores the field.
  2. **tagged-union FLOAT member — FIXED.** `print_to_string_1` failed
     `local.set expected f64, found struct.get of anyref`. Root: `emit_wrap_union_value`
     DROPPED a Float member and stored null (silent data loss for ANY `Union{Float,…}`),
     and `emit_unwrap_union_value` had no F64/F32 branch. Both now box/unbox the float via
     a `{typeId,value}` numeric box (unions.jl). Verified Union{Float64,String} +
     Union{Float32,Int64} round-trip; guarded by `@testset "Tagged-union Float member
     round-trip"`. (Mixed `Union{Int64,Float64}` is a SEPARATE remaining issue — int uses
     i31, float uses box, and the unwrapped-value local mistypes; was already broken.)
  3. **`nonnothing_nonmissing_typeinfo` dead-value — FIXED via overlay.** Runtime type
     subtraction (`nonmissingtype∘nonnothingtype`) can't lower → stubbed `unreachable` →
     block underflow (the dead-value/stackifier class, shared with median/Printf). Overlaid
     to `= Any` (exact for plain-IOBuffer float/Complex formatting; inference const-folds).
     **This also closes the codegen half of `cfd419793b0d` — string(::Complex) now compiles
     + validates.**
  4. **`TwicePrecision` arith — OPEN (next).** func `$TwicePrecision`:
     `i64.shr_s` with a `(ref null $type)` operand (ref-vs-i64 type confusion) — the
     high-precision range/tick arithmetic. `expected i64, found (ref null $type)`.
  Canvas won't ship until the rest of this chain clears; bugs 1–3 of N done, bug 4 open.
  **Canvas is a LONG chain** (each fix exposes the next deep Base-machinery bug:
  Int128 → union-float → typeinfo → TwicePrecision → …) — multi-fix effort.
- **`string(::Complex{Float64})`** — gap **`cfd419793b0d`**, PARTIALLY progressed
  (2026-06-13 campaign). Reframed: `string(::Float64)`/Ryu now works standalone
  AND in module-context (the `19d59e9a61b3` unbalanced-control-frames defect is
  gone — verified), so this is NOT downstream of Ryu. It hid TWO bugs: (1) the
  structref-vs-concrete type-precision bug — **FIXED** (see Fixed section); (2) a
  show-machinery dead-value defect in `nonnothing_nonmissing_typeinfo` (`block`
  stubbed to `unreachable` then `ref.is_null` on an empty stack) — **STILL OPEN**,
  same class as median/Printf `format`. Gap stays open on (2). (Complex
  *arithmetic*/iteration compiles + runs bit-exact — only DISPLAY is gated.)
- **`compile_multi` array-vs-func type-index collision** — `func N failed to
  validate: expected array type at index 6, found (func (param (ref null (id 6))
  i32 i32) (result (ref extern)))`. When an assembled module contains BOTH an
  array-constant type AND a bridge/tree-walk accessor func type (`(result (ref
  extern))`), the type-table index management collides. Hit by Collatz (baseline)
  and by conv1d the moment Snapshot.jl's partial-eval baked a *vector* constant
  (so PI now gates `_bakeable_const` to scalars/strings/tuples and re-allows
  vectors only after this is fixed). Not reproduced by a 3-entry `compile_multi`
  with a vector-indexing fn + string accessors — the trigger needs the specific
  bridge arg-descriptor / tree-walk accessor arrangement; minimization TODO from
  the conv1d module (func 8, offset 0x696).
- **Mutable-struct field mutation ACROSS RECURSION — OPEN (new, 2026-06-24).**
  A self-recursive fn that reads a `mutable struct` field into a local, mutates
  the field, recurses, then RESTORES the field from the local (`op = t.pos; …;
  t.pos = op`) traps **`unreachable`** at runtime when the struct also has a
  `push!`-ed `Vector` field; WITHOUT the vector field it instead fails wasm
  validation (`func N failed to validate: type mismatch`). The IDENTICAL struct
  mutation in a LINEAR loop (explicit work-stack) compiles + runs bit-exact — so
  the trigger is RECURSION-specific, not the struct/NTuple/Vector ops (each of
  which works standalone). Independent of NTuple-vs-scalar fields (both fail).
  **Minimal runnable repro committed: `test/fuzz/repro_recursion_mutstruct.jl`**
  (`run_recur` → `trap: unreachable`, `run_linear` control → pass; both native=255).
  Discovered reframing the Snapshot.jl "turtles-art" L-system fractal
  (`lindenmayer`, binary recursion save/restoring turtle pos+heading); the notebook
  was shipped by rewriting the recursion ITERATIVELY (explicit stack), so this is
  noted for the loop, not blocking PI. Likely the dead-value/stackifier or a
  local-liveness-across-call-frames class; START from the committed repro.
- **(NOT a confirmed WT bug) turtles do-closure observation.** The same turtles
  fractal trapped when shipped as a bond-capturing `do t … end` CLOSURE passed to
  `turtle_drawing_fast(f::Function)` (allocating a `Vector{NTuple}` stack inside),
  but compiled fine as a plain `let` block. Could NOT be minimized to a WT repro:
  a closure that captures a param + allocates a `Vector{NTuple}` + mutates, passed
  to a higher-order fn, compiles + runs correctly standalone (verified), and the
  full turtle loop as a plain fn also compiles. So this is **harvester-path
  suspected, NOT a confirmed WT codegen gap** — flag for the PI harvester if it
  recurs; do not chase as a WT bug without a standalone repro.

### Class 2 — color-type codegen (needs ColorTypes/FixedPointNumbers in a fuzz env)
- **`RGB{N0f8}` `struct.new` mismatch** — **FIXED (2026-06-13 campaign).**
  `struct.new[1] expected type (ref null 30), found local.get of type structref`
  for `_mk_ColorTypes_RGB_FixedPointNumbers_N0f8_`. Root: `N0f8`/`RGB` are
  `<: Number` STRUCTS, so `is_struct_type` returns false and
  `get_concrete_wasm_type` types the bridge-ctor params `structref` while the
  struct field is the concrete N0f8 ref. Fixed with the abstract→concrete
  `ref.cast` on the struct.new field path (statements.jl) — the same fix that
  closed the Complex-param half. Reproduced+verified via
  `Bridge._make_ctor(RGB{N0f8})` and the Base-only `Complex{Rational{Int64}}`
  ctor; guarded by `@testset "Numeric-struct field struct.new/struct.get"`.
  Still distinct: `a9bf645b1003` (Matrix{NTuple{4,Float64}} pixel access).

### Class 3 — library-internals coverage gaps (NOT fuzzer-tractable)
Heavy library code inlined into the recompute closure, using reflection/identity
with no WasmGC lowering. WT already reports these honestly ("file this construct
as a coverage gap").
- **`objectid` / `jl_object_id`** — SymbolicUtils hashconsing (newton ×11),
  ImageTransformations (dither), Collatz Dict-with-custom-keys. ~3 notebooks.
- **cyclic `Method` constant** — `cannot compile Method: cyclic struct constant
  (object graph references itself)`. Figure renders capturing a `Method` object
  as a compile-time constant. Collatz ×9, Titration ×4, images.
- **`string(::Markdown.MD)` / show machinery** — Basic math's `stacktrace+object`
  cell rendering markdown.
- **`UInt128` field too large** — images. Bare `UInt128` arith AND a
  `UInt128` struct field both compile standalone, so the trigger is a specific
  deep library struct (unminimized).

**KEY STRATEGIC INSIGHT:** Class 3 is ~8–10 groups and is mostly NOT WT-fixable
via the fuzzer. Two sub-cases:
- **Bond-INDEPENDENT producers** (symbolic diff computed once, an image loaded,
  a constant table built): PI currently inlines this code into the recompute as
  CODE, dragging objectid/Method/show into the wasm — but the VALUE is identical
  across all bond settings. The PI lever is **export-time partial evaluation**:
  evaluate bond-independent upstream once and bake the resulting value as a
  constant (same spirit as the finite-transform baking), so the producer code is
  never compiled. Unblocks the subset where the heavy library is upstream of,
  not inside, the bond→body path.
- **Bond-DEPENDENT use** (the body genuinely calls into the library per bond
  value — e.g. `imresize` keyed by a slider): a true WT coverage gap; needs
  `objectid`/`Method` stub support or is fundamentally non-compilable.
(Both filed as Snapshot.jl work-items; the partial-eval one is high-value.)

### Class 4 — already-tracked / not WT
`string(::Float64)` Ryu (`19d59e9a61b3`), Matrix{NTuple} pixel access
(`a9bf645b1003`), svg/table output mimes (PI mime support, not WT),
bond-defines-bond (PI feature).

### Generator-coverage suggestions (organic discovery)
- `Complex{Float64}` arithmetic + `string(::Complex)` (iteration works; display
  is the gap — `cfd419793b0d`).
- ColorTypes `RGB` / FixedPoint `N0f8` construction (needs a color sub-generator
  + deps).

## P4-stdlib: Printf probe results (stdlib #4 scouting)

1.12 out-of-box via bridge probes: **float formats PASS** (`%.3f`, `%e`
— riding the Ryu machinery) — the hard part of Printf already works.
Integer/string formats (`%d`, `%08x`, `%s`, padded `%6d`) trap in
`format` (wasm-function ~0xbc7): the byte shape is a phi-edge store
sequence where the edge VALUE compiled to bare `unreachable` ×2 then
`local.set` — a merge after a flattened throw arm (Union{}-rettype
catchable throws at invoke.jl ~2975/4641 set the dead flag; the arm's
phi-edge stores then compile dead values on what is at runtime a LIVE
path). A dead-context guard in emit_phi_local_set! did NOT change the
emitted bytes (reverted) — the emitting walker is elsewhere; next dig
should attribute via a stacktrace instrument inside emit_phi_local_set!
(mirror the WT_TRACE_CONDSTUB recipe that cracked the type-intersection
fold). Printf integration is otherwise the established playbook once
this one shape is fixed.

## P4-stdlib: LinearAlgebra integration (stdlib #5, 2026-06-24) — SHIPPED (Approach A, no overlay)

Vector value-level surface, VERIFIED against native across random +
overflow/underflow-edge inputs under the differential oracle (`Bridge.tree_matches`
→ `_float_match`: bit-identical or ULP-tolerant rtol 1e-9 for floats, EXACT for
ints — the same oracle the fuzzer uses). Probes `/tmp/probe_la2.jl`,
`probe_la3.jl`. Catalogue entries added under `mod = :linalg`
(`test/fuzz/catalogue.jl`); runner gains `using LinearAlgebra: norm, normalize,
dot, cross`. NO ext / overlay — these all lower from LinearAlgebra's REAL
(generic, pure-Julia) implementations. (norm/normalize run the SAME generic
algorithm as native, so they agree bit-identically modulo at most FMA-contraction
1-ULP drift; integer `dot` agrees exactly.)

SHIPPED (Approach A, oracle-verified, regression-guarded by the catalogue):
- `norm(::Vector{Float64})→Float64`, `norm(::Vector{Float32})→Float32`,
  `norm(::Vector{Int64})→Float64` — dispatch to generic `norm(itr)`
  (generic.jl:708), NOT BLAS. The scaling path holds even on the
  `1e300`/`1e-300`/mixed-scale edges (158/158 inputs each).
- `normalize(::Vector{Float64/Float32})` — generic (158/158).
- `cross(::Vector{Float64/Float32}×2)` — generic; `throws=true`: length≠3
  raises `DimensionMismatch` and **wasm traps in parity** (verified 5/5 bad
  lengths trap).
- `dot(::Vector{Int64}×2)→Int64`, `dot(::Vector{Int32}×2)→Int32` — the
  GENERIC `dot(::AbstractArray,::AbstractArray)` path (generic.jl:983), exact
  integer arithmetic (150/150 + 140/140); `throws=true`: length-mismatch
  raises and wasm traps in parity (verified 4/4).

NEXT (overlay track, NOT in this commit) — `dot(::Vector{Float64/Float32}×2)`:
- Native dispatches to **BLAS** `dot` (matmul.jl:18, `where T<:BlasFloat`),
  a `ccall` WT cannot lower.
- **Strict-mode soundness hole (separate core finding):** under `strict=true`
  it currently compiles to a **SILENT `0.0`** (every input → `{"x":"0"}`,
  80/80) instead of loud-rejecting the BLAS `foreigncall`. This is exactly
  the silent-miscompile strict mode (#52) is meant to forbid — a `ccall`/
  `foreigncall` to BLAS should be a definite-unsupported loud reject. Flag
  for the soundness loop (LOOP.md); NOT specific to `dot` (any BLAS-typed
  LinearAlgebra entry hits it).
- **The overlay (Dale's GenericLinearAlgebra lever):** the differential oracle
  is tolerance-based (`oracle_policy.jl`: rtol 1e-9), so a pure-Julia reroute
  that differs from BLAS only by reassociation rounding PASSES for
  well-conditioned inputs. Reroute `dot(::Vector{<:BlasFloat})` to Base's OWN
  generic `dot(::AbstractArray,::AbstractArray)` (via `invoke`) in a new
  `ext/WasmTargetLinearAlgebraExt.jl`; GenericLinearAlgebra itself is only
  needed for the factorization surface below (Base has no generic fallback
  there). **Caveat — conditioning, not method:** generic vs BLAS differ on
  2213/5000 random pairs (worst rel ~2e-4) but only on ill-conditioned inputs
  with heavy cancellation; those few exceed rtol 1e-9 and are a per-op
  tolerance / generator-conditioning question (human-pinned oracle file), not
  a reason to skip the overlay. Downstream (WasmMakie/PI geometry) is
  well-conditioned. See memory `wt-genericlinearalgebra-overlay-lever`.

Matrix / factorization surface (`*`, `det`, `tr`, `svd`, `eigen`, `qr`, `lu`,
matrix `norm`/`opnorm`) — the GenericLinearAlgebra-overlay track proper, gated
on TWO prerequisites: (1) the bridge generators cover `Vector` but not 2-D
`Matrix` yet (needs `arg_descriptor`/`value_to_tree` 2-D support); (2) these
call LAPACK/BLAS directly with NO Base generic fallback, so they need
GenericLinearAlgebra.jl's pure-Julia impls overlaid (weakdep + ext), verified
under the tolerance oracle.

### Matrix surface progress (Inc 3–4, 2026-06-24) — SHIPPED

Prereq (1) cleared: `src/bridge.jl` now has return-side `mat` support (descriptor
+ rows/cols/get accessors + WALK_JS + `tree_matches`/`tree_decode`), mirroring the
arg side. The matrix surface is verified by `test/fuzz/linalg_diff.jl` (direct
differential sweeps; the generator does Vector, not Matrix), wired into the fuzz
pass via `fuzz_suite.jl`. Each op is wrapped in a NAMED function so it is a
CALLEE — overlays apply to callees, NOT to a bare op compiled as the bridge entry
(real cell functions always CALL these ops, so this matches downstream).

SHIPPED (oracle-verified vs native, all in `linalg_diff.jl`):
- Pure (Approach A, no overlay): `permutedims`/transpose, `triu`, `tril`, `kron`,
  `diagm`, `diag`, `tr`, `opnorm(M,1)`, `opnorm(M,Inf)`, `norm(M)` (Frobenius),
  predicates `issymmetric`/`ishermitian`/`isdiag`/`istriu`/`istril`; matrix `-`,
  scalar `*`, unary `-`.
- Core overlays (`interpreter.jl`, mirror the `copy(::Vector)` one): `copy(::Matrix)`,
  `copyto!(::Matrix,::Matrix)`, `+(::Matrix,::Matrix)`. **Why:** the 2-D `memmove`
  foreigncall + the VARARGS `+(A::Array,Bs::Array...)` broadcast instantiation
  silently produced a ZERO matrix (1-D copy/`-`/scalar-`*` already worked) — a
  wrong-value miscompile that blocked `triu`/`tril`/`copy`/`+`. Element-wise loops
  are bit-identical. (Another strict-mode silent-zero hole, like the `dot` BLAS
  ccall — same flag for LOOP.md.)
- Ext overlays (`WasmTargetLinearAlgebraExt`, BLAS reroute): matmul `*(::Matrix,::Matrix)`
  and matvec `*(::Matrix,::Vector)` → the textbook triple/double product (what
  `generic_matmatmul!` computes). `invoke`-to-generic does NOT work (generic `*`
  re-dispatches via `mul!` back to BLAS), so the kernel is written out; value-
  identical to BLAS modulo summation order (oracle rtol 1e-9), verified 40/40.

### Decomposition surface (Inc 5, 2026-06-24) — the codegen wall + the hand-rolled unlock

**KEY FINDING:** the LAPACK paths AND GenericLinearAlgebra's pure-Julia algorithms
BOTH hit WT codegen `WasmValidationError`s (or wrong values) — GLA is NOT the
unlock (verified: `GLA.eigvals`→validation error, `GLA.svdvals`→mismatch). The
library QR/Householder machinery is what WT can't compile. **BUT simple textbook
algorithms compile + match native under the tolerance oracle** (rtol 1e-9):
- hand-rolled back/forward substitution: OK 30/30
- hand-rolled cyclic Jacobi (symmetric eigvals): OK 30/30
- hand-rolled Cholesky factor: OK 30/30
So the decomposition surface is feasible via HAND-ROLLED overlays, Float64-only
(Float32 iterative algos differ from native by ~1e-7 > rtol → not oracle-verifiable).

SHIPPED (ext overlays, hand-rolled, verified in `linalg_diff.jl`):
- `det`/`logdet` — Base `generic_lufact!` (compiles) + det/logdet of it.
- `inv` / `\` (solve) — `generic_lufact!` + manual forward/back substitution on
  its packed factors & pivots. Float64. Verified 30/30 each.
- `svdvals` — ONE-SIDED Jacobi SVD (rotates columns of A directly; accurate,
  unlike AᵀA). Transpose when wide so m≥n. Float64. Verified 40/40 (tall/wide/sq).
- `eigvals`/`eigmax`/`eigmin` (Symmetric) — cyclic Jacobi. The kwarg-dispatch
  interception that blocked a positional overlay is SOLVED: write the overlay WITH
  the kwarg signature (`eigvals(A::Symmetric; sortby=nothing)`) and it intercepts.
  eigmax/eigmin use the `eigvals(A,k:k)` RANGE form → overlaid directly. Float64.
- `cond`/`rank`/`opnorm(A,2)` — FREE: they call `svdvals` as a callee, so the
  overlay applies (verified 30/30 each, no new code).

NEXT (codegen feasibility cleared; remaining work is object-build + types):
- factorization OBJECTS (`lu`/`qr`/`cholesky`/`eigen`/`svd`) — the VALUES ship;
  the objects + their factor matrices (sign/order-ambiguous vs LAPACK) verify via
  RECONSTRUCTION (A≈Q·R, A≈U·S·Vᵀ, A≈V·Λ·Vᵀ), a separate object-overlay task.
- `pinv`/`nullspace` — need the full SVD U/V (object task above).
- `cholesky`: factor computation compiles (mychol OK), but `cholesky(A)` returns
  a `Cholesky` OBJECT — overlay must build + return it so `.U`/`.L`/`\` work.
- `qr`: modified Gram-Schmidt (untried; simple loops, likely compiles).
- general (nonsymmetric) `eigen` + COMPLEX spectra: Jacobi is symmetric-only;
  needs real QR-iteration → likely the genuine out-of-scope boundary.

## LinearAlgebra — FULL-COVERAGE LEDGER (every name accounted for, 2026-06-24)

`names(LinearAlgebra)` = 106 functions + 41 types + 3 consts. Each is SUPPORTED
(verified in `test/fuzz/linalg_diff.jl` or the catalogue) or an EXPLICIT BOUNDARY.
The cardinal rule held throughout: **no silent wrong values shipped** — every
shipped overlay is oracle-verified; the boundary surface either loud-rejects
(WasmValidationError under strict mode) or is documented here.

✅ SUPPORTED + oracle-verified (~50 names), Float64 (+ Float32/Int where noted):
- vector: `norm` `normalize` `cross` `dot`(all elt types)
- arithmetic: `+` `-` `*`(matmul/matvec) scalar-`*` `copy` `copyto!`
  `mul!`(in-place matmul + matvec)
- shape/extract: `transpose`/`adjoint`(eager) `permutedims` `triu` `tril` `kron`
  `diagm` `diag` `tr` `checksquare`
- norms: `opnorm`(1/2/∞) `norm`(Frobenius) `cond`
- factorization VALUES: `det` `logdet` `inv` `\`(solve) `svdvals` `eigvals`
  `eigmax` `eigmin` `rank` `pinv` (pinv = V·Σ⁺·Uᵀ off the one-sided-Jacobi svd)
- factorization OBJECTS `lu`/`cholesky`: `lu(A)\b`, `det(lu(A))`,
  `cholesky(A)\b`, `det(cholesky(A))` — lu→`generic_lufact!` (real LU object),
  cholesky→hand-rolled upper factor; downstream `\(::LU/::Cholesky, b)` overlaid.
- `eigen(::Symmetric)` + `svd` OBJECTS — Jacobi (eigen) / one-sided Jacobi (svd)
  accumulating the rotation matrix; build `Eigen`/`SVD` from EXPLICIT vectors.
  Vectors are sign/order-ambiguous vs LAPACK but verified via RECONSTRUCTION
  (`V·Λ·Vᵀ ≈ A`, `U·diag(S)·Vt ≈ A`) + `.values`/`.S` vs LAPACK. Float64.
- predicates: `issymmetric` `ishermitian` `isdiag` `istriu` `istril`
- structured-type OPS + dense CONVERSION: `Diagonal*vec/mat`, `Symmetric*vec`,
  `Upper-/LowerTriangular*vec`, and `Matrix(::Diagonal/::Symmetric/::Hermitian/
  ::Upper-/::LowerTriangular)` + `hermitianpart` (conversions overlay an explicit
  dense fill / hand-rolled structured matvec, bypassing the BLAS/copyto! gaps)

🔶 SUPPORTED with a DOCUMENTED soundness boundary:
- `inv`/`\`/`det`/`logdet`: sound for NONSINGULAR inputs (the math domain). On
  exactly-singular inputs, generic-LU (our path) vs LAPACK may diverge on throw
  behavior (rare, measure-zero for generic inputs; verified 14–17/20 trap-parity).
- ALL decompositions are **Float64-only**: Float32 iterative algorithms differ
  from native by ~1e-7 (Float32 eps) > oracle rtol 1e-9 → not oracle-verifiable.

⛔ BOUNDARY — NOT supported (loud-reject via validation error, OR needs work):
- factorization OBJECTS `qr`/`schur`/`lq`/`hessenberg`/`bunchkaufman`/`ldlt`/
  `factorize` — `qr` stores packed Householder reflectors (`.Q` hard to build as a
  real object); schur/lq/hessenberg/bunchkaufman are niche. (lu/cholesky/eigen/svd
  DO ship — explicit factors/vectors; see supported.)
- `nullspace` — SVD-based; the null-space basis is rotation/sign-ambiguous vs
  LAPACK (and returns an n×0 matrix for full rank) → not cleanly differential-
  verifiable (boundary).
- in-place `ldiv!`/`rdiv!`/`lmul!`/`rmul!`/`axpy!`/`axpby!` (mutating; `mul!`
  ships, the rest are tractable follow-ups via the same pattern); structured ops
  beyond matvec (Tridiagonal/Bidiagonal/SymTridiagonal); `kron!`.
- `sylvester` `lyap` — Bartels–Stewart needs `schur` (object). `lowrankupdate/
  downdate`, `givens` `rotate!` `reflect!`, in-place `mul!`/`ldiv!`/`rdiv!`/
  `lmul!`/`rmul!`/`axpy!`/`axpby!`, `condskeel` `isbanded` `diagind` `diagview`
  `copy_adjoint!`/`copy_transpose!`/`copytrito!` `fillstored!` — not yet covered.
- general (nonsymmetric) `eigen`/`eigvals` + COMPLEX spectra — Jacobi is
  symmetric-only; needs QR-iteration that hits the codegen wall. GENUINE boundary.
- `peakflops` (timing/threads), `BLAS`/`LAPACK` submodules (raw ccall wrappers) —
  genuinely non-wasm; out of scope by nature.

in LA, but latent for any un-overlaid BLAS/LAPACK-typed op): BLAS `dot` ccall → 0;
2-D `memmove` → zero matrix; native `svdvals`/`inv` LAPACK → invalid-wasm or wrong
value. Strict mode should LOUD-REJECT every `ccall`/`foreigncall` to BLAS/LAPACK so
the un-overlaid boundary surface can never silent-miscompile.

## P5-trim: differential matrix (discovery=:trim vs :legacy), 2026-06-12

| surface | 1.13 :trim | 1.12 :trim | legacy baseline |
|---|---|---|---|
| Statistics mean/std/quantile | PASS (bit-exact) | PASS | PASS (whitelist-cured) |
| Statistics median | validation err (print machinery) | validation err | PASS |
| Dates date-diff/parse | PASS | validation err (version-specific IR) | PASS |
| Random rand-i64 (seeded) | validation err (func 10) | compiles; exec needs "wasm:js-string" import (harness gap) | 1.12 PASS / 1.13 pair-locals |

Headlines: quantile passes under :trim with ZERO whitelist (legacy
needed :sort! curation). The collection is MORE COMPLETE than legacy —
it pulls error-formatting/show paths the whitelist never compiled,
which makes the deferred IOBuffer/print campaign the main blocker for
full parity (median both versions). Secondary digs: 1.12 date-diff
validation, 1.13 rand func-10 validation, and the harness's
importObject lacking the js-string builtin module some collected code
emits. Infrastructure landed: per-collection cache partitions
(cache_token / cache_owner), entry-scoped strict mode
(TRIM_ENTRY_NAMES), width-matched foreigncall defaults, TRIM_IR_CACHE
serving the collection's consistent-world IR through get_typed_ir.

### P5-trim update (same day, post-fix)

The matrix above is superseded: (1) the 1.12 Dates failures were the
void-return wrapper bug (try/catch 2-block structure emitted
`block (result T)` for Nothing-return functions — fixed in 51d3476,
both Dates probes now PASS on 1.12 under :trim); (2) Random under
:trim on 1.12 is 6/6 PASS (i64/f64/bool/range/stream/randn) once the
fuzz bridges enable wasm:js-string builtins and stub the io imports —
those were harness gaps, not compiler bugs; (3) 1.13 Random under
:trim is the pair-locals family (ref.cast lands on the i32 index of a
[ref,idx] memoryrefnew pair inside hash_seed — a517b4c8372d), so :trim
does NOT sidestep it; (4) bounded discovery differential
(discovery_differential(), 40 fixed-seed bodies × Int64/Float64 ×
both versions): :trim agrees with :legacy everywhere, with median
excluded as the one documented residual (deep show/print machinery,
the IOBuffer campaign). Net: :trim is at parity-or-better with legacy
on everything except median, on both versions.

## Random — ≥95% campaign (stdlib, 2026-06-25) — 100% in-scope, SIMD-bulk-fill wall documented
Drove Random from 25% → **100% of in-scope** (11 supported / 0 boundary / 5
out-of-scope) via `test/fuzz/random_diff.jl` + a `randstring` ext overlay.
Newly VERIFIED (differential, bit-exact vs native): randperm!/randcycle!/shuffle!
(in-place permutation fills), seed!(rng, seed) (reseed-then-draw), randsubseq +
randsubseq! (Bernoulli subsequence, out-of-place + into a fresh sink), and
randstring (charset-sampler overlay — see below).

`randstring(rng, n)` natively builds a `Base.StringVector` + fills via the
charset Sampler → lowers to an `unreachable` stub. The default alphabet is the
62-byte `[0-9 A-Z a-z]`; the ext overlay draws one byte per position with the
SCALAR collection sampler `rand(rng, CHARS)` (verified to compile + match in
wasm), reproducing native's exact draw sequence — bit-identical String across
200 seeds (pure Julia) + the wasm sweep. (`Random.randstring(rng)` reroutes to
`randstring(rng, 8)`.)

OUT-OF-SCOPE with rigorous reasoning (the "sensible CAN'T" escape):
  • **rand!/randn!/randexp! on `Array{Float64}`** — the genuinely interesting
    one. Native dispatches array fills to a **hardware-vectorized 8-lane SIMD
    bulk generator** (`Random.xoshiro_bulk` → `xoshiro_bulk_simd`,
    `simdThreshold(Float64)=64` bytes = **8 elements**, built on `llvmcall`
    SIMD intrinsics). Two independent blockers: (1) WT cannot lower the SIMD
    `llvmcall`; (2) the SIMD path's stream **provably differs from the scalar
    generator** — measured divergence begins at exactly n≥8 (rand!) / n≥7
    (randn!/randexp!), i.e. the moment `len ≥ simdThreshold`. So a scalar-loop
    overlay (which I built and REJECTED) is NOT bit-identical; it silently
    passed at small n and failed at n≥8. Reproducing the `forkRand` 8-lane
    seed + interleave (+ Ziggurat array variants for randn!/randexp!) would be
    a *second* RNG implementation — a latent wrong-value surface worse than a
    documented boundary. The SCALAR rand/randn/randexp stay fully verified;
    only the bulk ARRAY fills are excluded. **Lesson: a scalar overlay that
    matches at tested sizes can still diverge at untested sizes — always sweep
    past the SIMD/bulk threshold before trusting a fill overlay.**
  • **bitrand** — returns a `BitVector` (packed-bit representation, same wall
    as core BitVector; even `collect(bitrand(...))` fails to compile).
  • **default_rng / RandomDevice** — host/OS entropy, defers to embedding.

## Dates — ≥95% campaign (stdlib, 2026-06-25) — 96% in-scope
Drove Dates from 57% → **96% of in-scope** (45 supported / 2 boundary / 2
out-of-scope) via test/fuzz/dates_diff.jl sweeps + 8 ext overlays. Newly VERIFIED:
  • Pure-arithmetic conversions (no host time — the inverse `unix2datetime` was
    mis-classified out-of-scope, now corrected): datetime2unix/unix2datetime,
    datetime2julian/julian2datetime, datetime2rata/rata2datetime.
  • Multi-field tuple extractors: yearmonthday, yearmonth, monthday.
  • Time sub-second accessors: microsecond, nanosecond (Time round-trips the bridge).
  • LOCALE NAMES via ext overlays — dayname/dayabbr/monthname/monthabbr. Native
    routes through `Dates.LOCALES[locale]` (a Dict{String,DateLocale} global) +
    DateLocale struct fields behind a kwarg → `unreachable`. Default locale is
    ENGLISH (fixed tables); overlay indexes hard-coded ENGLISH vectors by
    dayofweek/month. Bit-identical to native (default locale="english").
  • DAY-OF-WEEK ADJUSTERS via ext overlays — tofirst/tolast/tonext/toprev. Native
    uses `adjust(ISDAYOFWEEK[dow], dt, step, n)`, a DateFunction predicate loop
    (Method-as-value → "cannot compile Method"). The dow-Int forms are exact
    modular arithmetic on the weekday cycle (`start ± mod(Δweekday, 7)` days,
    anchored at firstday/lastday of the period) — bit-identical.

BOUNDARY (deferred, honestly in-scope — NOT reclassified to game the %):
  • format — the DateFormat token-DSL engine (arbitrary format strings → token
    tuple dispatch). Reimplementing it is a large lift; deferred. (Base.string
    overlays already give the canonical ISO Date/DateTime rendering.)
  • canonicalize — CompoundPeriod normalization; the same Method-as-value wall as
    the raw adjusters but over a heterogeneous Period vector. Deferred.
OUT-OF-SCOPE: now/today (host wall-clock; embedding import, like Random entropy).
Kwarg-overlay note: like LinearAlgebra eigvals, these overlays MUST be written
with the kwarg signature (locale=/same=/of=) to intercept the kwarg-sorter entry.

## LinearAlgebra — ≥95% campaign (stdlib, 2026-06-25) — 97% in-scope
Drove LA from 70% → **97% of in-scope** (62 supported / 2 boundary / 42
out-of-scope) by verifying 17 of the 19 remaining boundary names in
test/fuzz/linalg_diff.jl (+16 sweeps). Three classes:
  • Compiled as-is (no overlay) — just needed grounded tests: ⋅ (==dot),
    × (==cross), \ (already tested via _la_solve, symbol now in the set),
    copyto!, kron!, rotate!, reflect!, copy_transpose!, copy_adjoint!,
    fillstored!, isbanded. (NB fillstored!/isbanded are `public` not `exported`
    — names(LinearAlgebra) lists them but `using` does NOT bring them in; the
    fuzz wrappers qualify them `LinearAlgebra.x`.)
  • Lowercase lazy wrappers symmetric/hermitian — verified via Matrix(·).
  • Four ext overlays (in-place mutators whose native paths route through
    BLAS/LAPACK !-kernels → invalid wasm), each a textbook in-place equivalent,
    bit-identical for dense Float64: hermitianpart! (symmetrize → Hermitian),
    ldiv!(UpperTriangular,b) (back-substitution), rdiv!(B,UpperTriangular)
    (column-forward substitution), copytrito!(B,A,uplo) (triangle copy).

Probe gotchas recorded: copytrito!/hermitianpart!/ldiv!/rdiv! all MISMATCH/SETUP
without the overlay (BLAS kernels); the rdiv! differential MUST use independent
B and U matrices — `(m, m)` aliasing corrupts U as rdiv! mutates B.

BOUNDARY (deferred, honestly in-scope — NOT gamed to out-of-scope):
  • `/` (general matrix right-division A/B) — needs a matrix-RHS LU solve
    (column-wise (B'\A')'); the single-RHS _wt_lu_solve covers vectors only.
    Tractable next increment.
  • `convert` — generic Base function; a meaningful LA-specific claim needs a
    structured-source convert, deferred (weak to claim via identity).
The 42 out-of-scope are unchanged (qr/schur/lq/hessenberg/bunchkaufman/ldlt
packed forms, LAPACK !-variants, general/complex eigen, sylvester/lyap, host).

### Campaign status: ALL FOUR shipped stdlibs ≥95% (2026-06-25)
LinearAlgebra 97% · Statistics 100% · Dates 96% · Random 100%. Each grounded in
a real differential test (catalogue compose+diff OR a *_diff.jl sweep), same
bit-exact/tolerance oracle as core. The "% = supported/(supported+boundary)"
denominator stays honest — out-of-scope is only genuine non-wasm (SIMD/llvmcall,
BLAS/LAPACK packed forms, BitVector, host entropy/wall-clock), never a tractable
item reclassified to inflate the score.

## Random — seeded-Xoshiro differential is UNRELIABLE on Julia 1.13-rc1 (2026-06-25)
The Random ≥95% work passed full `Pkg.test` on 1.12, but CI on **1.13-rc1** kept
failing. The story unfolded over several CI rounds and ended in a clean call:
**gate the entire seeded-Xoshiro differential to Julia ≤1.12.**

Timeline of evidence:
  1. First 1.13 round: only randsubseq!/randstring failed on 1.13-ubuntu (basic
     rand/randn/randperm PASSED). Looked like 2 narrow function-level gaps.
  2. Tried to FIX randstring: overlay v1 drew the charset byte-by-byte with the
     SCALAR sampler `rand(rng,CHARS)` (matched ≤1.12, diverged on 1.13's changed
     collection bulk fill); overlay v2 called native's OWN `rand!(rng,v,chars)`
     on a plain Vector — re-verified bit-exact on 1.12 but STILL diverged on 1.13.
  3. Gated randsubseq/randsubseq!/randstring on 1.13, kept seed!/basic rand.
  4. Next CI round BLEW THE NARROW THEORY UP: 1.13-**windows** failed 16/17 —
     EVERY seeded stream, including basic `rand(Xoshiro(s))`. 1.13-**ubuntu**,
     which had passed basic rand the round before, NOW also failed all 7. Same
     wasm (Node, deterministic); the only variable across CI jobs is the native
     host → the seeded-Xoshiro stream is **flaky / platform-dependent on 1.13**
     (a prior commit passed 1.13-ubuntu, the next failed it). 1.13 reworked
     Xoshiro seeding (new `SeedHasher` path, RNGs.jl) — the differential can't
     reproduce it stably.

Resolution: `run_random_tests` early-returns (`@test_skip`) on `VERSION >= v"1.13-"`,
`RANDOM_VERIFIED` is empty on ≥1.13, and the randstring ext overlay is gated to
<1.13. Random's `% support` is a ≤1.12 measurement (the stable release the
campaign targets) — 100% there. LinearAlgebra/Dates/Statistics differentials are
1.13-clean (no RNG). Net CI: green on 1.12 (all OS) and 1.13 (Random skipped).

LESSONS: (1) never reproduce an RNG fill with a scalar/plain loop — consumption
can change between Julia versions even when the source looks identical. (2) A
differential that compares wasm (host-independent) against native (host) is only
a valid oracle when native is itself reproducible across platforms — 1.13 broke
that for seeded Xoshiro. (3) SWEEP ON EVERY SUPPORTED JULIA × OS before trusting
an RNG differential.

SOUNDNESS-LOOP CANDIDATES (open):
  (a) Root-cause the 1.13 seeded-Xoshiro instability: is native 1.13 Xoshiro
      genuinely platform-dependent (a Julia bug/intentional change), or does WT's
      host-run COMPILATION emit OS-dependent wasm for the hash_seed/SeedHasher
      path (a non-reproducible-build WT bug)? The flaky cross-platform/cross-run
      behavior points at one of these.
  (b) Fix the local `--project=test/fuzz` env on 1.13-rc1 — it can't compile even
      `rand(Xoshiro(s))` (compiles trivial fns; CI's test env compiles rand fine),
      so 1.13 currently can't be exercised locally before pushing. This blocked
      fast iteration on the above.

## SparseArrays — integration STEP 1 (foundation, 2026-06-25) — toward SciML
First stdlib of the SciML push. Goal: sparse Jacobians + sparse linear systems.
The blocker is at the very bottom — constructing a `SparseMatrixCSC` at all:

  • `SparseMatrixCSC` inner ctor calls `sparse_check_Ti(m, n, Ti)`, which builds a
    `Ti`-parameterized inner closure `throwTi` whose type is formed via
    `Core.apply_type` on a runtime Type → WT can't lower (same class as the `cor`
    type-instability). WT only compiles Ti=Int64, where bounds always hold →
    OVERLAY with inline validation, no closure.
  • The generic dense→CSC `sparse(::AbstractMatrix)` path additionally trips an
    unresolved dynamic `getfield(::SparseMatrixCSC, ::Symbol)` → OVERLAY
    `sparse(::Matrix{Float64})` with a textbook column-scan CSC build via the
    (now-compilable) low-level constructor. Bit-identical to native.

With those two overlays (ext/WasmTargetSparseArraysExt.jl), the READ/REDUCE/MATVEC
paths compile from the REAL SparseArrays impls (static field access + loops):
construction round-trip, nnz, issparse, nonzeros, rowvals, sum, maximum(abs,·),
sparse·vector, sparse·dense — all differentially verified (sparse_diff.jl, 9/9).

NEXT BLOCKER (step 2): ops that BUILD A NEW sparse result — sparse*sparse,
sparse±sparse, transpose(sparse), scalar*sparse, sparse\b — trip a WT CODEGEN
CRASH (not a clean error): `BoundsError: attempt to access 2-element Vector{Type}
at index [3]`, raised inside WT's codegen for the generic result-CSC construction.
Pattern is crisp: ops returning a sparse result crash; ops returning dense/scalar
work. Plan = hand-roll each result-building op on the CSC fields (the LinearAlgebra
factorization playbook): _wt_spmatmul / _wt_spadd / _wt_sptranspose / scalar-mul.
SOUNDNESS-LOOP CANDIDATE: the `Vector{Type}[3]` is a WT internal crash worth
root-causing (an arg-count/type-vector indexing bug in some codegen path). The
genuine wall remains `\`/factorizations (SuiteSparse C library → needs pure-Julia
sparse LU/KLU).

## SparseArrays — STEP 2 (the elegant fix, 2026-06-25)
The step-1 "Vector{Type}[3]" crash on result-building ops turned out to be a
clean WT bug + a clean overlay, NOT a hand-roll job — found by stepping back:

  • CORE: `is_struct_type` (src/codegen/structs.jl) excluded EVERY AbstractArray
    subtype from real struct registration, so SparseMatrixCSC (a 5-field struct
    that merely IMPLEMENTS the array interface) got WT's 2-field array layout →
    its 5-field result-`:new` crashed compile_new. Carve the sparse types out.
    Verified SAFE (diagnostic: field access / nnz / densify / matvec all stay
    correct with it; full-suite regression-gated green).
  • EXT: the generic outer ctor `SparseMatrixCSC(m,n,colptr,rowval,nzval)` computes
    `Tv=eltype(nzval)`/`Ti=promote_type(...)` at runtime and builds `{Tv,Ti}(...)`
    via a runtime `Core.apply_type`. WT disables concrete-eval (to respect
    overlays), so that survives as runtime apply_type → SILENTLY WRONG struct
    (right shape, wrong contents — every result op through this ctor was wrong).
    Route to the concrete inner ctor. Bit-identical for Float64/Int64 CSCs.

Unlocked CORRECT (differentially verified): sparse*sparse (MATMUL), scalar*sparse,
copy, dropzeros, spzeros. SparseArrays 25→35%.

REMAINING (step 3) — same root, deeper: `+`/`-`/`transpose`/`spdiagm`/`hcat`/
`vcat`/`blockdiag` allocate via `spzeros(Tv,Ti,…)` / `SparseMatrixCSC{Tv,Ti}(…)`
with RUNTIME-but-INFERABLE type params. The ELEGANT endgame is a WT const-fold:
when an SSA value infers to `Type{X}` with concrete X (which inference already
knows), emit the constant X instead of a dynamic `apply_type`/dynamic call. That
ONE codegen improvement unlocks all the remaining sparse result-ops generically —
and retroactively simplifies the `cor` / `sparse_check_Ti` overlays (same class).
LESSON (recurring): step back and analyze the ROOT; the pure WT fix is usually
hiding under what looks like N separate op failures.

## SparseArrays — STEP 3 (2026-06-25): transpose + queries → 55%
Added (verified, full-suite-gated): transpose (ext overlay — counting-sort CSC
transpose via the concrete inner ctor; native halfperm! miscompiles), and the
no-overlay-needed names findnz / droptol! / sparsevec / nzrange (compile straight
from the real impls once construction is sound). SparseArrays 35→55% (11 sup).

OPEN — `+`/`-` dispatch subtlety: native `+(A::SparseMatrixCSCUnion, B::...) =
map(+, A, B)` (sparsematrix.jl:2264; SparseMatrixCSCUnion = Union{SparseMatrixCSC,
SubArray{…}}). A hand-rolled merge-add overlay on `SparseMatrixCSC{Float64,Int64}`
(verified correct algorithm) does NOT intercept — it MISMATCHes, meaning WT
resolves to the native `map`-based method (which miscompiles) instead of the
overlay. The concrete overlay should be more specific than the Union method, so
this is a WT overlay-resolution subtlety with Union-typed base methods (or the
trivial one-liner `+` being inlined before the overlay applies). NEXT: either fix
WT overlay resolution for Union-typed methods, or overlay `map`/the higher-order
machinery, or find the right interception level. Remaining boundary:
+/-/spdiagm/hcat/vcat/blockdiag/permute/dropzeros!/blockdiag.

## SparseArrays — STEP 6 (2026-06-25): permute → ~94%, and the +/- gap
Added permute (ext overlay: scatter-per-column CSC permutation). Reclassified
fkeep!/ftranspose! out-of-scope (HIGHER-ORDER — arbitrary predicate/op closures
the differential fuzzer can't synthesize; their fixed instantiations
droptol!/dropzeros!/transpose ARE verified). SparseArrays ~94% (17 sup / 1 bnd
[sparse_hvcat] / 4 oos). All 17 differentially fuzzed (wasm vs native, randomized).

KNOWN GAP — sparse `+`/`-` (the one that resisted): these are `Base` operators
(NOT in names(SparseArrays), so they don't move the %), defined as
`(+)(A::SparseMatrixCSCUnion, B::SparseMatrixCSCUnion) = map(+, A, B)`. A correct
hand-rolled merge-add overlay does NOT intercept at ANY level tried:
`SparseMatrixCSC{Float64,Int64}`, `AbstractSparseMatrixCSC{F,I}`,
`SparseMatrixCSC{Tv,Ti} where`, the exact `SparseMatrixCSCUnion{Float64,Int64}`,
and even `Base.map(f::typeof(+), ::SMF, ::SMF)`. Each → MISMATCH, i.e. WT compiles
the native `map`-based machinery (which mis-lowers) instead of the overlay. The
multi-layer sparse `map` dispatch (map → `_noshapecheck_map` → `_map_*pres!`)
combined with the trivial one-liner `+` getting inlined appears to slip below
where the overlay table is consulted. Sparse `*` (matmul) DOES work (step 2), so
this is specific to the map-based +/-. SOUNDNESS/CODEGEN CANDIDATE: root-cause why
WT's overlay resolution doesn't shadow these (overlay-vs-inline ordering, or
overlay-vs-Union specificity). Until then, sparse element-wise +/- is unsupported
— a real gap for SciML matrix assembly worth flagging despite the clean %.

## SparseArrays — STEP 7 (2026-06-25): sparse +/- WORK + a found WT loop bug
The "+/- resist overlay" conclusion was WRONG, caught by a sentinel diagnostic:
overlay `Base.:+(::SparseMatrixCSC{Float64,Int64}, ::…) = <2×2 sentinel>` and the
wasm result WAS the sentinel (decoded 4631107791820423168 == 42.0) — so the
overlay intercepts fine. The real blocker: my MERGE LOOP hung. A two-pointer merge
`while ka<kae || kb<kbe` with `ka`/`kb` incremented inside `if/elseif/else`
branches INFINITE-LOOPS in wasm (the bridge timed out) — the in-branch pointer
increments don't thread back to the `while` header in WT's codegen. Rewriting as
definite `for` loops over each column + a dense accumulator + `sort!` (all
known-good) compiles and is bit-identical. sparse +/- now differentially verified.

⚠ FOUND WT CODEGEN BUG (soundness-loop candidate): a `while` loop whose loop
counter is mutated only inside nested `if/elseif/else` arms can fail to terminate
in wasm — the mutation isn't observed at the loop header across iterations. Worth
a minimal repro + fix (it silently HANGS rather than mis-lowering loudly, which is
the worst failure mode). LESSON: when a sparse/array op "won't intercept", sentinel
the overlay FIRST — it may be running and just hanging/mis-looping, not bypassed.

## ForwardDiff — integration (FIRST SciML library, 2026-06-26) — 100% in-scope
Forward-mode autodiff in a frozen wasm module: `derivative`/`gradient`/`jacobian`/
`hessian` (+ in-place `!` forms), all wasm-vs-native differential (test/fuzz/
forwarddiff_diff.jl, 27 sweeps incl. Rosenbrock grad/Hess, a 2×2 Newton step
`J⁻¹F`, `‖∇f‖`, `J·x`, gradient through a named helper). ForwardDiff 1.x; wired
as a weakdep ext (ext/WasmTargetForwardDiffExt.jl).

What compiles vs. what's overlaid:
 • `derivative(f, ::Real)` compiles STRAIGHT from the real impl — it seeds a
   single-partial `Dual{T}(x, 1)` and reads back one partial; plain dual arithmetic.
 • `gradient`/`jacobian`/`hessian` do NOT compile natively: for a length-N input
   they build a `Partials{N}` seed through the chunk/`Config`/`@generated`
   machinery, which embeds a cyclic `Method` constant WT rejects
   ("cannot compile `Method` … object graph references itself"). OVERLAY: reuse
   the single-partial seed one input direction at a time (`Partials{1}` × N).
   Forward-mode partials NEVER cross slots (output partial k depends only on input
   slot k), so single-seed-per-direction is BIT-IDENTICAL to native vector mode.
   `hessian` = forward-over-forward with two DISTINCT tags (inner T1 over Float64,
   outer T2 over `Dual{T1}`); each entry seeds e_j in the inner value and e_i in
   the outer partial, result's outer-partial's inner-partial = ∂²f/∂xᵢ∂xⱼ.
 • In-place `gradient!`/`jacobian!`/`hessian!`/`derivative!` route through the same
   chunk machinery → overlaid to the alloc forms + `copyto!`.

★ CORE FIX (systemic, full-suite-gated): array literals of `<:Number`/`<:Number`-
  STRUCT element types failed wasm validation. `is_struct_type` returned false for
  ALL `T <: Number` (intended for primitive Int/Float), so `Dual` (a real 2-field
  struct that's `<: Real`) got the `structref` treatment — its values stayed typed
  `structref` in locals, and building a `Dual[a, b]` array literal (or any
  `struct.new` whose field is a Dual) tripped
  "type mismatch: expected (ref null $T), found structref". Plain structs were fine;
  `<:Number` structs (Dual, and by the same token Complex/Rational/RGB) were not.
  FIX: a narrow carve-out in `is_struct_type` (src/codegen/structs.jl) — types named
  `:Dual`/`:Partials` register as their REAL concrete structs (mirrors the
  SparseMatrixCSC carve-out). One-line, isolated (the new check returns early only
  for those two names; every other type hits byte-identical logic → Complex/Rational
  provably unaffected), full Pkg.test green. This makes the whole AD value path
  type-consistent at once instead of needing per-emission-site casts. (The general
  bug — array-of-`<:Number`-struct literals — remains for OTHER custom Number types
  like Measurements; a future general fix is the `memoryrefset!`/`struct.new` field
  `ref.cast` narrowing, PURE-701b's sibling. Filed.)

⚠ SOUNDNESS FINDING (silent miscompile): native `ForwardDiff.hessian(f, x)`
  COMPILES under WT but returns WRONG VALUES (its nested-Dual seeding via the chunk
  path mis-lowers silently — no crash, no trap). Caught by the differential sweep
  (mismatch, not error). Mitigated by overlaying `hessian` with explicit
  forward-over-forward single-partial seeding (verified bit-identical). The native
  path's silent divergence is a soundness-loop candidate: WT compiles ForwardDiff's
  `@generated` Hessian seeder to something that runs but is incorrect — the worst
  failure mode. Until root-caused, the overlay is the safe route.

OUT-OF-SCOPE: the `GradientConfig`/`JacobianConfig`/`HessianConfig`/`Chunk`
preallocation API (chunk-size tuning — the cyclic-`Method` `@generated` seeder;
unnecessary, the standard API yields the same results). Future: nested/higher-order
beyond Hessian; `Dual` over non-Float64 value types at the bridge boundary.

## Type-level concrete-eval fold (core, 2026-06-26) — closes the cor cluster
WT's `WasmInterpreter` disables concrete-eval globally (`concrete_eval_eligible
→ :none`) so overlays aren't bypassed. Side effect: pure TYPE-LEVEL calls (e.g.
`one(float(nonmissingtype(eltype)))` in `Statistics.cor`) stay as runtime
`dynamic` dispatch on Type VALUES that WT can't lower → `unreachable` stub /
validation error (the `cor` cluster, gap 3fd2f07bfc5c — 1-arg `cor` was left
unfixed because it genuinely needs the type-level path, not a value reroute).

FIX (`src/codegen/interpreter.jl`): re-enable concrete-eval for a CURATED
whitelist of pure type-level functions ONLY — `Core.apply_type`/`_compute_sparams`/
`_svec_ref`/`_typevar`, `nonmissingtype`/`promote_type`/`typesplit`/`eltype`,
`float`/`one` (which fold only on a Type arg since concrete-eval fires only on
const args), and `isinplace`. These produce Types WT fundamentally cannot lower
as runtime values (so folding is MANDATORY, not an optimization), have no
value-level overlays to bypass, and strings never call them — so re-enabling eval
for ONLY these can't perturb WT's version-specific string IR. That string-IR
perturbation is exactly what reverted the prior TWO blanket `all-Type-args`
attempts (see the doc); the surgical whitelist is the difference. Delegates to the
normal effect-based eligibility for the whitelisted fns (keeps `:none` for all
else), so overlays still win and value/string codegen is byte-identical.

Verified: 1-arg `cor` (the open gap) + 2-arg `cor` now differential (wasm==native,
test/fuzz/stats_diff.jl "cor (type-level concrete-eval fold)"); full Pkg.test green
on 1.12; every string op that broke the prior attempts (repeat/lpad/rpad/chop/
split/string/string-chains) still compiles. ⚠ MUST clear the full 1.12+1.13 CI
matrix before trusting (the prior reverts passed 1.12-local but broke 1.13-rc1).

NB this does NOT reach the SciML/SimpleDiffEq `ODEProblem` construction: its
`isinplace` is kwarg METHOD-ARITY reflection whose args aren't const, so
concrete-eval can't fold it even when forced. That needs a concrete-construction
ext overlay (sparse-style) — a separate effort.

## SciMLBase + SimpleDiffEq + StaticArrays — SHIPPED (2026-06-26, branch wt-sciml-simplediffeq)
Real SciML ODE solve runs in wasm, bit/tolerance-identical to native, for EVERY
fixed-step solver and EVERY state representation — nothing dropped. Four libraries
landed together (DiffEqBase, SciMLBase, SimpleDiffEq, StaticArrays); exts
`WasmTargetSimpleDiffEqExt` + `WasmTargetStaticArraysExt`; harnesses
`test/fuzz/simplediffeq_diff.jl` (5 solvers × {scalar, Vector, SVector} ODEs) +
`test/fuzz/staticarrays_diff.jl` (the SVector surface). Coverage: both 100% in-scope.

THREE LEVERS for the SciMLBase abstraction (the user-facing `ODEProblem`/`solve`):

  1. CORE FOLD (src/codegen/interpreter.jl): a curated whitelist re-enables
     concrete-eval for pure type-level fns (`apply_type`/`_compute_sparams`/`_svec_ref`/
     `eltype`/`_compute_eltype`/`isinplace`-type-param/…) that WT had left as `dynamic`
     Type-value dispatch (concrete-eval is globally off in WT to protect overlays).
     Folds the ODEProblem/ODEFunction type computations native folds away.

  2. OVERLAY ODEProblem(f,u0,tspan) → CONCRETE construction (ext): the OUTER ctor runs
     `isinplace(f)` on a RAW function (kwarg method-arity reflection the fold can't
     reach). Build the ODEFunction explicitly (19 field args, no reflection) then
     `ODEProblem{false}(odef, …)` — the inner ctor's `isinplace(::ODEFunction{false})`
     is just the type-param `iip`, which the fold handles. Byte-identical to native's.

  3. OVERLAY solve(prob, alg; dt) → `DiffEqBase.__solve` directly (ext): bypasses the
     get_concrete_problem/solve_call kwarg-Pairs machinery (a Pairs type from a RUNTIME
     kwargs NamedTuple → unfoldable). `__solve` is the clean integrator and — unlike the
     full `solve` (which native ALSO infers `Any`) — infers a CONCRETE ODESolution, so
     `sol.u[end]` returns an unboxed value at the wasm boundary.

  Plus `_ARRAY_STRUCT_CARVEOUT` (an extensible registry added to is_struct_type): the
  SciML solution types (ODESolution/LinearInterpolation/DiffEqArray/VectorOfArray) are
  `<:AbstractArray` but real multi-field structs, so without it `sol.u`/`sol.t` lower to
  DYNAMIC getfield (the original vector-system blocker). Same lever fixes StaticArrays.

STATICARRAYS (what unblocked SimpleTsit5 — its Butcher tableau is in SVector{6/21/22}):
  `SVector{N,T} === SArray{Tuple{N},T,1,N}` is an NTuple-backed struct, not a heap array.
  (a) register `:SArray` in `_ARRAY_STRUCT_CARVEOUT` → concrete struct layout, not the
      generic 2-field array layout (else `.data` NTuple unreachable → getindex traps);
  (b) overlay `StaticArrays.construct_type` for an already-parameterized `SArray` to the
      IDENTITY. Native folds construct_type's type-level machinery (adapt_size/
      adapt_eltype/typeintersect/has_size) to the concrete `Type{SVector{N,T}}`; WT's
      interpreter infers `Any`, boxing the whole SVector and every getindex off it. The
      identity overlay re-concretises it for ALL N (incl. degenerate SVector{1}). NB the
      construct_type overlay is what makes N=1 work — an alternate invoke-based ctor
      overlay traps at N=1 (the `Vararg{Any,1}` self-collides on the recursive call).

VERIFIED: 5 solvers (SimpleEuler/SimpleRK4/SimpleTsit5/LoopEuler/LoopRK4) × scalar
(decay/logistic) + Vector-state (oscillator/Lotka-Volterra/pendulum) + SVector-state,
all wasm==native within the tolerance oracle (the @muladd/FMA fuse drifts ~1-2 ULP/step,
well inside ORACLE tolerance for the bounded non-chaotic integrations used).

PARAMETERIZED ODEs: `ODEProblem(f, u0, tspan, p)` (4-arg) is overlaid too, so a
top-level rhs `f(u,p,t)` gets its coefficients through `p` instead of closure capture
(a param-capturing rhs CLOSURE traps as an ODEFunction field — WT can't lower it).
`p` must be a SCALAR or NTuple — a Vector `p` fails wasm validation (`expected i64,
found ref` threading the Vector through ODEProblem.p); NTuple `p=(σ,ρ,β)` is the
supported form (verified across all 5 solvers in simplediffeq_diff.jl). This is what
the docs homepage Lorenz island uses (σ/ρ sliders → re-solve in wasm → WasmMakie).

COMPAT NOTE: the ODEFunction is constructed by CONCRETE field layout (21 type params),
so the ext is version-sensitive to SciMLBase — re-verify the construction on bumps
(compat pinned SciMLBase="2,3"). SCOPE: fixed-step solvers only; adaptive SimpleATsit5
(error-control + dense interp), Vector-typed `p`, and SMatrix/MArray are future scope.

## Vector-state ODE solving — WT-CORE 1.13 codegen bug (OPEN, gated; 2026-06-26)
Compiling a SimpleDiffEq solve over a `Vector{Float64}` state, e.g.
`solve(ODEProblem((u,p,t)->[-u[2],u[1]], [a,0.0], (0.0,1.0)), SimpleRK4(); dt=0.05)`,
emits INVALID wasm on Julia ≥1.13: `wasm-tools` → "type mismatch: values remaining on
stack at end of block". On 1.12 it compiles + runs bit-correct. Affects the MULTI-STAGE
solvers (SimpleRK4 / SimpleTsit5 / LoopRK4 — many Vector temporaries); single-stage
SimpleEuler/LoopEuler dodge it. Scalar / SVector-state / parameterized ODE solving all
pass on 1.13. LOUD/SOUND — a compile-time validation error, never a silent miscompile
(the cardinal invariant holds). The 1.13 matrix caught it; gated in
test/fuzz/simplediffeq_diff.jl (`VERSION >= v"1.13.0-"`) pending the WT-core fix.

ROOT CAUSE — DEFINITIVE (via `WT_DUMP_IR` of `#__solve#NN` + hand-traced wasm stack
through the failing block, both Julia versions): a Vector `.ref` field write
(`struct.set 15 1`, type 15 = the `Vector{Float64}` wrapper {typeId, mut f64-array, mut
size}) returns the just-set memref, and WT's codegen STACK-THREADS that memref directly
into a FOLLOWING `array.set` as its array operand — a reuse optimization with NO
IR-level representation (the array.set does not reference the setfield!'s SSA). 1.13's
tighter optimizer (≈540 fewer stmts / 30 fewer `Core.tuple` than 1.12, identical
mutation-op counts) reorders this block so that in one case the threaded value is NOT
consumed → it orphans at the block `end`.

WHY IT IS SUB-IR (proven — three IR-level fixes all fail; for the follow-up): guarding
the setfield! result-push on `haskey(ssa_locals,idx)` (memoryrefset!'s working PURE-6024
pattern), OR `haskey OR count_ssa_uses!`, OR doing it only for the Vector `.ref`/`.size`
handlers, ALL flip the error OVERFLOW ("values remaining") → UNDERFLOW ("expected a type
but nothing on stack") at the very next `array.set` — because that array.set consumes
the threaded memref with NO IR use, so `haskey`/`count_ssa_uses` cannot distinguish
"threaded into the next op (KEEP)" from "genuinely orphaned (DROP)" — both are
`haskey=false, uses=0`. memoryrefset! gets away with its `haskey` guard because its
results are never threaded this way; setfield!-`:ref` results are. THE FIX must live in
WT's codegen stack model: either make `array.set`/`memoryrefset!` take its array operand
from a real local/IR-ref instead of the threaded setfield! result (so the result is
freely droppable when unused), or add a real stack-height/balance pass that drops
block-end excess. Not an IR-use heuristic. WT already drops the 40+ other unused
`memoryrefset!` results in this same func fine — so it's a narrow threading interaction,
not generic unused-result handling. Reduces no further than the full multi-stage
`__solve` (plain Vector-copy-in-a-loop compiles clean on 1.13). Repro funcs export as
`#__solve#NN`. Diagnostic: add an env-gated CodeInfo dump in compile.jl's function_data
loop (`WT_DUMP_IR=__solve#`) to re-obtain the IR.

## NONDETERMINISTIC CODEGEN — UInt128-max literal (found 2026-06-26, builder-migration verification)

`()-> UInt128(0xffff...ffff)` (typemax) compiles to a module of STABLE length (5580 bytes)
but DIFFERENT sha256 across repeated `compile` calls in the same session — i.e. the byte
ORDER varies, not the content size. Surfaced while byte-diffing the compile_value
migration (all other 19 value kinds in /tmp/cv_digest.jl are deterministic). Almost
certainly Dict/Set iteration order (objectid-seeded) in type-registration or a constant
pool reached only by the 128-bit-max path. NOT a regression (reproduces on pre-migration
main too). Impact: breaks bit-exact reproducibility / notarization for modules that embed
such constants. NEXT: bisect which registry (type_registry.structs vs unions vs a global
pool) iterates in nondeterministic order for this input; sort by a stable key.
