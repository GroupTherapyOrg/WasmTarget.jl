# The anti-drift audit log

The locks check what they measure; drift hides in what none of them counts. So the work
pauses at every session start and at most every 5 commits for a full audit against
`dev/CHARTER.md` (AGENTS.md, "The anti-drift audit"), and records it here. L148 fails when
the last entry is more than 5 commits behind HEAD or an entry leaves out an area.

The method:

1. Re-read `dev/CHARTER.md`, `AGENTS.md` and `dev/MARCH.md` in full.
2. Audit every change since the last entry, `git diff <audited through>..HEAD`, in four
   areas, each by a read-only auditor (no edits, no Julia runs):
   - **builder**: `src/builder/`: wasm_builder's structure, and a builder that knows
     nothing of Julia;
   - **collection and planning**: `trimcollect.jl`, `compile.jl`, the frontend: the closed
     world as Julia's compiler builds it;
   - **emission and diagnostics**: the rest of `src/codegen/`: dart's lowering, correct or
     loud;
   - **enforcement and prose**: `test/`, `dev/`, the docs: locks that guarantee behavior,
     charter edits that only strengthen, prose that is true.
3. Check each changed definition against every clause: its dart anchor by what the dart
   code does at the pinned commit (not only by the symbol's name); a quarantine's Julia
   necessity is real; no layering leak; no process-global state; no second path; correct
   or loud; a new lock negative-tested.
4. Fix the findings before new work. Record the entry: the range, one `Area:` paragraph per
   area with its findings, and a `Resolution:` for each finding (the commit that fixed it,
   or the MARCH item and ratchet that now carry it).

## 2026-09-29 — audited through 7acc21c9 (4fc785d2~1..7acc21c9: batches 51–59)

The first audit, done because none had been: 45 findings. Two were read as silent wrong
values; measured (batch 61), neither was: E1 raised a codegen bug where a rejection belongs,
and E7 did not reproduce. The fix batches run in the order below, before any new work.

Area: builder — (B1) `StatementTrace` and `WasmModule.trace` put Julia's CodeInfo and
MethodInstance in the builder; dart's ModuleBuilder holds wasm parts only. (B2) a block's type
has two sources (a positional block type and `inputs`/`results`): `try_table!(b, cs, I32)` is
tracked void and encoded with a result; dart's `_beginBlock` derives the encoding from the
label. (B3) branch typing is checked four times (`validate_br!`, `validate_br_if!`,
`validate_branch_types!`, `try_table!`); dart has one `_verifyBranchTypes`. (B4)
`validate_pop_any!`'s quarantine is false: `global_set!`, `ref_is_null!`, `ref_as_non_null!`,
the `call_ref` callee, `local_set!` of an unknown index and five validator arms pop untyped.
(B5) anchors naming other code: `_local_type` invents AnyRef; `_true_field_type`,
`_true_elem_type`, `_true_call_sig` fall back to the claimed type; `write_valtype!(::RefType)`
never writes the one-byte shorthand; `add_global_ref!` takes raw initializer bytes
(closures.jl writes them by hand, unvalidated); `julia_to_wasm_type` is a translator in the
builder; `builder_diagnose` is dead; `reset_validator!`'s quarantine is false. (B6) 15 opcode
constants without a use, unreachable CATCH_REF/CATCH_ALL_REF branches, `add_export!`'s
docstring, campaign narration. (B7) the sourceMappingURL section writes its own framing;
`source_map_url` is set after construction (an `existing_module` records a partial map);
sources are paths, not URIs; `append_builder!` carries a fragment's last mapping. (adjacent)
`diagnostics.jl:313` turns an unknown line 0 into line 1.

Area: collection and planning — (P2) `_ENROLLMENT_REASONS`, a new process-global Ref, and an
invented fallback reason for every base-collected function (entries were never recorded);
the same trim quarantine on `_DYNAMIC_ROOT_MIS`, `_ENROLLED_CALLABLE_TYPES`,
`_TRIM_DISPATCH_CANDIDATES`, `_TRIM_INVOKE_ONLY`, which explains the collector, not why its
state is process-global. (P3) the invoke_in_world edge is worked out in three places with
different operand types; a non-unique target becomes neither an edge nor a dynamic site; no
exact-type check. (P4) MCClosedWorld never enables Prune; HiddenEdges cannot express the
collector and pruner disagreeing; the fma roots are not modeled. (P5) the catch-alls re-infer
on an interrupt or out-of-memory; internal ArgumentErrors pass unlocated. (P6)
`throw_located_collection_failure` cites CFECrashError for WT's own re-inference;
`add_codegen_export!` cites ExportsBuilder.export but renames silently. (P7) a source-mapped
build is a second module shape, and the extra entry points drifted (no diagnostics_sink).
(S6) the plan compile normalizes 2-tuples it never receives; `optimize_ir=false` errors for
every planned function. (side) a third loop-bounds definition (context.jl:1243);
`count_ssa_uses!`, a second operand table missing Upsilon and PhiC; statements.jl:902 scans
the whole body.

Area: emission and diagnostics — (E1) SILENT WRONG VALUE: `_emit_getfield_runtime_name!`
reads a field by Julia's field order from a projected layout: `getfield(::DataType, :hash)`
reads `dfs_high`, `:instance` reads `abstract`; TypeName too; Module always throws. (E7)
`_lower_invoke_in_world!` re-infers the return type, and for a callee returning `Nothing` can
box an earlier statement's value (`isempty(b.v.stack)` on a seeded fragment). (E8) the vararg
dynamic-getfield arm emits a Symbol operand as I64 (the trap batch 53 removed from the tuple
arm). (H1 = P1 = E2) a rethrow records a fresh stack, not the caught one (dart `visitRethrow`
rethrows `stackTraceLocal`; Julia keeps the backtrace); a throw records its stack only in a
source-mapped build (dart: `errorThrowWithCurrentStackTrace` always). (E3) L142 incomplete:
`Union{Nothing,Matrix}` reaches `register_vector_type!` with no rank check. (E4) which types
have a dedicated layout is decided twice. (E5) L143's one rule is three (calls.jl:293,
statements.jl:1804, :1861). (E6) `_is_direct_struct_constructor` cites a dart mechanism that
never substitutes `struct.new`. (E9) unmapped prologue and trailing unreachables; a statement
with no location borrows the previous one's; `map_to_statement!` runs outside the located try.
(E10) the titlecase overlay's reason may be stale. (E11) a false docstring.

Area: enforcement and prose — (H2) smoke and the differential files run only the
source-mapped shape; the plain build is never run. (H3) L138's tolerance covers all 40
SimpleDiffEq cases, and `_sde_step_calls_muladd` passes on any method of the file. (M4) C6
and C10 read CLOSED while MARCH 13.1, 13.14, 13.15 are open; C10's "one verdict in minutes"
has no check. (M5) six commits added citations to the charter without recorded direction
(each only strengthens; L125 requires a citation for every new check). (M6) locks that pin
text: L101 counts deleted names while `SymbolicTryCatch(CATCH_ALL)` still validates; L143
forbids one spelling; L145 exempts all of generate.jl; L65 was loosened (misses `;` and line
start); L12 is vacuous and names the retired R2; L144, L147 pin comment text. (M7 = P8)
tracing forces locals and the locator never checks that the traced build still answers
wrong; an unroutable closure calling a routable callee reports a spurious parting. (L8)
MARCH 13.15 holds finished work and results; HISTORY has no entries for e226aab7..7acc21c9.
(L9, L10) README: `discovery=:legacy`, Statistics "bit-exact", removed mechanisms, absent
overlays, "tolerance-aware"; the retracted "cyclic Method" reason in two files; the
`ensure_exception_tag!` docstring; formal/README maps one function to two models. (L11) the
statement lane's draw digest is printed, not asserted. (self) no ratchet counted
process-global state (MARCH 13.7); a requested validation without wasm-tools warned and
skipped; `discovery` took one legal value.

Resolution: batch 60 (this commit) — B1: the trace is codegen state on a per-compilation
Translator (dart translator.dart:96), passed in by the caller; L149 locks the builder free of
Julia compiler objects, and moved `julia_to_wasm_type` and its union helpers to codegen (B5
in part). P2: collection returns a ClosedWorld and planning a ClosedWorldPlan, values that
replace five process-global Refs; every planned function carries its recorded reason (entries,
each :invoke callee by its call site), and a missing one is a collector defect raised at
planning. R40 counts the process-global state left (8), with an exact allowlist. A requested
validation without wasm-tools throws. `discovery` is gone. P5: interrupts and out-of-memory
pass through both catch-alls. L9, L10: README and the stale reasons corrected. M4, M5:
proposed to Dale, who answered "don't wait on me" (2026-09-29): C1, C3, C6, C7, C8 and C10
now name their open findings as `Planned:` and read OPEN until those land; a citation L125
requires for a new check is added with the check. Batch 61 — E1: a runtime-name getfield rejects at its statement, with
why, on a Module (Julia reads the global binding; WT threw FieldError where Julia returns) and
on a layout that does not hold Julia's fields in Julia's order (DataType, TypeName: measured,
the original raised a WasmInternalError, not a silent value) or a MemoryRef field. E7: the
call's result is detected by stack height (not reproduced by a planted Nothing-returning
callee; the height is the exact test). E8: a runtime tuple or vararg index is taken only when
its type is an integer (a Symbol on a vararg pack raised a WasmInternalError; it now throws
FieldError as Julia does). Batch 61b — Therapy.jl's downstream job paused at Dale's
direction (MARCH 13.16 restores it). Batch 62 — H1, H2, P7: one module shape. Every module
imports `wasmtarget.stack_trace` and exports its tag; every throw carries the stack at the
throw, and a rethrow the stack its catch stored in `\$current_stack` (the source-map test
rethrows and still names the first throw; with the fresh-stack rethrow planted back it fails);
a source-mapped build is the plain build plus its URL section (a test checks the bytes); every
host import WT creates is answered by one HOST_RUNTIME (`host_runtime_js()`, L150), which every
harness and the docs example use; a framework module declares the imports before its own
definitions or is told how. N1 (found while fixing H1): `\$current_exn` was found by its type,
the first mutable anyref global; globals now carry dart's names and are found by name. Also
fixed here, what batch 60's CI found: the fuzz bridges still passed `discovery`, and on Julia
1.13 the planning check found an enrollment nobody recorded — an atomic modify's operator
(`:invoke_modify`), now recorded with its statement. E9 (unmapped instructions, borrowed
locations) is not done: it stays with MARCH 13.15. Batch 63 — B2: block!, loop!, if_! and try_table!
take only the frame's inputs and results and derive the encoding as dart's `_beginBlock` does
(void, the one result's value type, or a function type it defines); the positional block type
is gone, so `try_table!(b, cs, I32)` cannot be written (a test asserts no such method). Only 5
of 225 probes changed, and modulo renumbering their modules are identical: one-result blocks
now encode their value type instead of a hand-made function type. B3: br, br_if and every
try_table catch go through validate_branch_types!, dart's one `_verifyBranchTypes`. Measured
first: with br's check removed, all of Phase 29 still passed — no test rejected a wrong-typed
branch; module_builder_validation now does, for br and br_if, each negative-tested. Next, in
order: the second audit (L148); 64 B4, B5 (typed pops,
no fallback types); 65 H3 (the native reference computes muladd as fma: bit-exact); 66 M7, L11; then P3
with P4 (the model first), E3–E6, B5–B7, P6, S6, M6, L8, E10, E11 and the side notes.

## 2026-09-30 — audited through 9366d55b (7acc21c9..9366d55b: batches 60–63)

The second audit, of the first audit's fix batches: 37 findings. Three were wrong answers,
all reproduced (A2E1–A2E3), all older than the range and carried into it.

Area: builder — (A2B1) `return_!` checks nothing; dart's `return_` checks the function's
results. (A2B2) one-result block types are encoded by codegen's `encode_block_type`, a second
value-type encoder that disagrees with `write_valtype!` and has no NonNullAbstractRef arm.
(A2B3) `_block_type!` accepts a raw byte (0x40, a packed type) as a result. (A2B4)
`validate_else!` drops an if's inputs; an if with results and no else is not rejected. (A2B5)
`throw_!` checks the caller's `inputs`, not the tag's. (A2B6) N1's lookup by name is not dart's:
dart keeps the global it defines and writes names only into the name section. (A2B7)
`select_t!` takes raw bytes; `global_get!`, `call_indirect!` and `call_ref!` fall back to the
caller's types. (A2B8) the builder still reads `OPTIONS[]` and hosts `JSValue`, `WasmGlobal`.
(A2B9) stale prose (OperandStack.tla, `validate_br!`'s loop claim, instr_ir.jl:94) and a
twice-computed catch depth. (A2B10) C1 and C7 still listed B2 and B3.

Area: collection and planning — (A2C1) the reason table misses edges Julia's compile queue
follows: a finalizer, a `:cfunction`, and on 1.13 `:new` of a Function; the pruner follows
neither those nor `:invoke_modify`. (A2C2) two more catch-alls re-infer on an interrupt, and
internal ArgumentErrors still pass unlocated. (A2C3) the Translator holds only the trace; the
plan is republished through TRIM_IR_CACHE, whose reset to `nothing` lets a later read fall to
a second inference. (A2C4) `:invoke` edges are walked twice and the planner mutates the
ClosedWorld's dict. (A2C5) `collect_new_pairs!` keeps a default reason. (A2C6) the source-map
and trace entries lack `diagnostics_sink` and the framework keywords. (A2C7) the
existing_module check runs after collection; the tag is found by position. (A2C8) a closure's
dispatch-candidate key lacks the prepended closure type. (A2C9) new locks pin text.

Area: emission and diagnostics — (A2E1) WRONG ANSWER: `pop_exception` did nothing, so after a
nested catch a `rethrow()` rethrew the nested exception (reproduced: native 1, wasm 2). (A2E2)
WRONG ANSWER: `catch e` read the last region entered before it, so an outer catch after a
nested try region bound the nested exception (reproduced inside A2E1's case and alone).
(A2E3) WRONG ANSWER: `rethrow(e)` ignored `e` (reproduced: native 1, wasm 2). (A2E4)
HOST_RUNTIME is a second list, not generated from the module. (A2E5) a Union mixing a
primitive and a struct-stored number is not boxed (`Union{Int64,Int128}` → i64), and
`julia_to_wasm_type` keeps placeholder fallbacks. (A2E6) E8 takes any Integer; Julia's field
index is an Int. (A2E7) the exception tag is found by position. (A2E8) false prose.

Area: enforcement and prose — (A2P1 = A2E1). (A2P2) README and docs instantiate modules with
no imports, false since batch 62. (A2P3) the new import breaks WasmMakie, Snapshot and the
docs islands too, and only Therapy is tracked. (A2P4) the clause status counted a ratchet at 0
as closed; the charter requires a lock; Planned markers were stale and incomplete. (A2P5) L148
checks recency, not coverage (unchained entries, `--ancestry-path` on merges, rebases). (A2P6)
first-audit findings left only in this file's "Next" line; E9 claimed by 13.15 but absent.
(A2P7) C3's tolerance wording is narrower than L138; cov and cor claims disagree. (A2P8) R40
depends on spelling; STANDALONE_INTRINSIC_BODIES fills during a compilation. (A2P9) L150's
text match; B3 has no lock; restated locks not negative-tested. (A2P10) prose: README's stray
quote, "a lock" for R38, "the builder checks every instruction" while B4 is open,
ClosedWorld.tla's retired name, and "At Dale's direction" where Dale delegated.

Resolution: batch 64 — A2E1, A2E2, A2E3 fixed as Julia's exception stack: a try region's
enter saves the exception and stack being handled, its pop_exception restores them, `catch e`
reads the top, and `rethrow(e)` puts `e` on top and keeps the caught stack. Smoke group
exception_stack pins each case; planting the pop no-op back and planting `rethrow(e)` back each
fail it. Planting the pop no-op back also exposed a fourth defect, now fixed: the wrong-value
locator aborted Julia's process on IR with try regions (a probe after an Upsilon or PhiC node),
so a wrong answer took the whole run down; it now names the first divergent statement, and a
function compiled from a bespoke body (rethrow) is not traced. A2P4: a cited ratchet keeps its
clause OPEN until it is a lock; the 14 ratchets at 0 became locks (R36 negative-tested); every
clause's Planned names its open MARCH rows and findings. A2P6: every open finding is now on
dev/MARCH.md 13.17 in the order it is taken, and E9 is on 13.15. On A2P10's last point:
Dale's "don't wait on me" (2026-09-29) delegated the charter markers; ed7f2323 said "direction".
Everything else: MARCH 13.17.
