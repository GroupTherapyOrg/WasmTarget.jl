## FAQ

**Q: I'm a researcher at a university. Can I use this?**
A: Yes, completely free under the Academic Use terms. No need to contact me (though I'd love to hear what you're building).

**Q: I'm building an open source project that depends on WasmTarget.jl. Is that okay?**
A: Yes, completely free under the Open Source Use terms.

**Q: I work at a big company but I'm just experimenting personally.**
A: Personal experimentation and learning is always free under the Personal Use terms. If your company starts using it for business purposes — customer-facing products, internal tools, dashboards, anything that supports business operations — that's when a Commercial License is needed.

**Q: We're a funded startup but haven't hit $1M revenue yet.**
A: You're covered under the Small Business terms. When you grow past that threshold (congrats!), reach out about a Commercial License.

**Q: We're only using it for internal tools, not a product we sell. Do we need a Commercial License?**
A: If your organization exceeds the $1M revenue threshold, yes. Internal tools, dashboards, documentation systems, and developer infrastructure all count as Commercial Use. The license isn't about whether your customers see it — it's about whether your business benefits from it.

**Q: What if we can't afford the suggested pricing?**
A: Email me. I'd rather have you using WasmTarget.jl with a discounted license than not using it at all. We'll figure something out.

**Q: Can we get an invoice or formal agreement for our legal team?**
A: Yes, I can provide proper documentation for your records.
